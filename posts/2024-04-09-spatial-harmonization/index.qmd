# Why use spatially harmonized geography?

The [Demographic and Health Surveys](https://dhsprogram.com/) (DHS) are
the leading source of population and health data for low and
middle-income countries. The data from the nationally representative DHS
samples can be disaggregated by regions and, in some cases, by
sub-regions, such as districts. However, changes in the boundaries of
reported regions are common, due to either shifts in the survey sampling
strategy or due to political changes within countries. Researchers using
DHS data to study change over time need to hold space constant by using
regions with a consistent geographic footprint to get meaningful
results.

[IPUMS DHS](https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs/index.shtml) has addressed the
issue of changing boundaries by providing users with both **spatially
harmonized** (or *integrated*) and **sample-specific** geographic
variables and GIS boundaries. Harmonized variables provide consistent
geographic units for a country across the sample years, facilitating
analytical comparisons across time. Sample-specific variables retain all
geographic detail from each sample and are *not* consistent over time.

## The spatial harmonization process

DHS survey boundaries are obtained from the DHS Program’s [Spatial Data
Repository](https://spatialdata.dhsprogram.com/home/) and overlaid on a
GIS software system. When geographic boundaries of a later sample do not
align with units of the previous DHS survey for that country because of
boundary changes, we create larger aggregated units that are stable over
time. We refer to this process as the [spatial
harmonization](https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs/gis.shtml) of geographic
boundaries.

If administrative units split or merge, the harmonized unit will have
the boundaries of the largest version of the unit. If a territory is
redistributed between two or more units, the units are combined. Some
detail is always lost in the process of spatial harmonization because
administrative units are merged to find the geographic least common
denominator.

In a few cases, boundaries have been reorganized to such an extent that
harmonization is nearly impossible. In such cases (e.g., for Cameroon,
Guinea, Jordan, and Mali), we have typically created sets of consistent
units spanning different year ranges and placed them in different
integrated variables. Sometimes early DHS surveys labeled regions
through vague descriptive terms (e.g., "Coast" or "Mountains") rather
than naming recognized political units. In such cases, we have provided
only sample-specific geographic variables (e.g. for Congo Brazzaville,
Cote D'Ivoire, and Yemen).

# Case Study: Access to safe drinking water

We can demonstrate the usefulness of spatially harmonized geography by
creating thematic maps displaying the percentage of households in the
DHS data that are using improved sources for drinking water. The United
Nations' [Sustainable Development Goal
6](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/)
calls for "Ensuring Access to Water and Sanitation for All," and the
United Nations notes that access to safe water is "the most basic human
need for health and well-being."[@UN_SDG6] The U.N. further notes that
water and climate change are linked, with droughts exacerbating water
scarcity.

Improved sources of drinking water are here defined as piped water,
water from wells and tube wells, surface water from springs and rivers,
rainwater, and water purchased from a truck or in bags or bottles.
Information about drinking water collected in DHS surveys and how that
information is harmonized by IPUMS can be found in the IPUMS DHS
[`DRINKWTR`](https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs-action/variables/DRINKWTR#codes_section)
variable. More details can be found in chapter 16 of the [DHS guide to
statistics](https://dhsprogram.com/data/Guide-to-DHS-Statistics/index.cfm).

## Countries and samples

In this demonstration, we will highlight the sub-Saharan countries of
Malawi, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The table below
lists these countries and their sample years and notes the changes in
boundaries for each country. For Malawi, we use sub-regions or the
second level administrative units; here, 28 sub-regions in 2010
increased to 32 sub-regions in 2016. For Tanzania and Zambia, the
regional boundaries changed from one sample to the next. For Zimbabwe,
there were no changes in regional boundaries from one sample year to
another. We also display a single sample for Mozambique in our year 1
maps. Note that, for the purposes of this demonstration, we do not show
all the sample years available in IPUMS DHS, but rather only selected
sample years.

| Country    | Survey Year 1 | Survey Year 2 | Boundary changes?                    |
|------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| Malawi     | 2010          | 2016          | Yes—28 sub-regions to 32 sub-regions |
| Tanzania   | 2010          | 2015          | Yes—26 regions to 30 regions         |
| Mozambique | 2011          | --            | No—single year with 11 regions       |
| Zambia     | 2007          | 2013          | Yes—9 regions to 10 regions          |
| Zimbabwe   | 2010          | 2015          | No—10 regions in both years          |

## Visualizing the percent of households using improved drinking water

All maps shown below represent the percentage of households that use
drinking water from improved sources. For the countries listed in the
table above, paired maps display results from two time periods. **Map
A** shows results from the earlier survey (i.e., 2010 Malawi, 2010
Tanzania, 2011 Mozambique, 2007 Zambia, and 2010 Zimbabwe) and **Map B**
displays results from the later survey (i.e., 2016 Malawi, 2015
Tanzania, 2013 Zambia, and 2015 Zimbabwe). Shades of the color blue
represent spatially harmonized maps; shades of the color green appear on
sample-specific maps. In general, the darker the color, the higher the
percentage of households using improved sources of drinking water.

**Figure 1** displays two sample-specific GIS maps, meaning the spatial
boundaries for the two time periods for a given country are not the
same. These maps show that, overall, the percentage of households using
improved drinking water increased. The rate of increase differs,
however, both between countries and within countries.

While very broad conclusions about change based on sample-specific
geography may be sound, a closer look at the maps shows problems with
using sample-specific geography. We have circled three areas affected by
changes in geography. Specifically, the changes consist of splitting of
boundaries in eastern Zambia (the largest circle), reorganization of
boundaries in northern Tanzania (the top circle), and separation of
rural and urban areas in central Malawi (the right-hand circle).

### When spatial harmonization is necessary

**Figure 2** displays the part of Zambia where two units split up to
form three units. A new political region, Muchinga, was formed from
parts of the Northern and Eastern regions. Although the names of the
Northern and Eastern regions remained the same, their spatial footprint
changed from 2007 to 2013.

If we focus on our metric of households with access to improved drinking
water, it initially appears that the percentage in the Eastern region
rose dramatically from 16% to 72%, while the change in the neighboring
Northern region was from 19% to 30%.

Given changes in boundaries, the apparent increase in clean water access
in the Eastern region is misleading. It is quite possible that rural
areas from the former Eastern region in 2007 formed much of Muchinga in
2013, with the latter having only 35% of households with access to
improved drinking water. The actual change for the Eastern region may be
a shift toward more urban composition as it shed rural territory, rather
than a sanitation revolution.

The solution to the problem of changing boundaries is imposing
integrated geography for this section of Zambia. In this case, the three
regions of Northern, Muchinga, and Eastern are combined into one region,
with results mapped in **Figure 3**. Here, we see more modest
improvement in this aggregated region, with the percentage of households
with access to an improved water source changing from 18% to 52% between
2007 and 2013.

consistent boundary.](images/zoom1_spatialHarm1.png)

As **Figure 4** shows, between 2010 and 2015, boundaries in Tanzania
were redrawn such that three units (Kagera, Mwanza, and Shinyanga) were
reorganized to form five units (Kagera, Mwanza, Shinyanga, Simiyu, and
Geita). While it is mechanically possible to map our metric for these
various regions in the two years, boundary changes preclude our drawing
meaningful conclusions about progress within sub-national units. The
Tanzanian case illustrates a general principle: holding space constant
is critical in analyzing change at sub-national levels, because units
that have changed boundaries cannot be compared across time in a
meaningful way.

Creating integrated geography for this part of Tanzania required
aggregating smaller units into a single larger unit, as show in **Figure
5**. Focusing on the single combined region, we see that the share of
households with an improved source of drinking water increased from only
40% to 56% between 2010 and 2015.

area.](images/zooms_SampleSpecific2.png)

### Gains and losses from using integrated geography

For spatial harmonization, we hold boundaries constant over time. In our
prior examples, sub-national boundaries were merged to override any
boundary changes that occurred between DHS samples. While that approach
enables an apples‐to‐apples temporal comparison of places, detail that
might be useful for the analysis gets lost.

Boundary changes in Malawi illustrate this point. Consider **Figure 6**
and **Figure 7**. Map A from 2010 shows 74% households using an improved
source of drinking water in Nkhata Bay, with the number inching up to
76% in 2016. The blue spatially harmonized maps in Figure 7 also show a
lack of change. However, Figure 7 hides the advantaged sanitary position
of Mzuzu City, which split from Nkhata Bay, with 99% of households in
that city having improved drinking water in 2016. Similar results mark
other urban areas, such as Lilongwe city, Zomba city, and Blantyre city
(Zomba and Blantyre not displayed on the map). Taking full advantage of
sample-specific geographic detail demonstrates that, in this instance,
apparent regional progress in safe water access was largely localized in
urban areas. As this case illustrates, sample-specific geography often
provides greater detail and should be used in conjunction with spatially
harmonized geography.

### When geographic boundaries don’t change

While Zambia, Tanzania, and Malawi all had regional boundary changes
between DHS samples, sometimes regional boundaries stay the same across
two or more DHS surveys. This was the case for Zimbabwe between 2010 and
2015, as shown in **Figure 8**, which displays all the countries used in
this demonstration. For instances like Zimbabwe, IPUMS DHS still offers
multi-year “integrated geography” variables (without modifying
boundaries), for the convenience of researchers and to ensure that
geographic footprints as well as regional labels stay the same across
time. In other cases, only a single sample is available for a country in
the DHS, for all years or within a limited time span. This is
exemplified by Mozambique, with a single sample from 2011 (shown in Map
A but not included in Map B).

# Conclusion

This piece has stressed the importance of using spatially consistent
geography while drawing conclusions over time in thematic maps. Using
harmonized geographic variables from IPUMS DHS is just as essential in
other approaches to studying change over time, such as summarizing
results for individuals or for households via descriptive statistics or
in multivariate analyses in which region is a dependent variable.
Similarly, studies of the effects of localized policies, based on phased
implementation of educational reforms or public health drives, must
ensure that geographic variables maintain consistent spatial footprint
over time.

IPUMS DHS offers several advantages to researchers, such as simplifying
data discovery and file management, supplying extensive
variable-specific documentation online, and allowing analysts to
download customized files with just the samples and variables relevant
to their research project. The integrated geographic variables and GIS
shapefiles available only through IPUMS DHS are another important “value
added” feature essential for sound research into change over time. More
