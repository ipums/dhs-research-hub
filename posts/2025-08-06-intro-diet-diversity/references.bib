	abstract = {It is widely anticipated that climate change will negatively affect both food security and diet diversity. Diet diversity is especially critical for children as it correlates with macro and micronutrient intake important for child development. Despite these anticipated links, little empirical evidence has demonstrated a relationship between diet diversity and climate change, especially across large datasets spanning multiple global regions and with more recent climate data. Here we use survey data from 19 countries and more than 107 000 children, coupled with 30 years of precipitation and temperature data, to explore the relationship of climate to child diet diversity while controlling for other agroecological, geographic, and socioeconomic factors. We find that higher long-term temperatures are associated with decreases in overall child diet diversity, while higher rainfall in the previous year, compared to the long-term average rainfall, is associated with greater diet diversity. Examining six regions (Asia, Central America, North Africa, South America, Southeast Africa, and West Africa) individually, we find that five have significant reductions in diet diversity associated with higher temperatures while three have significant increases in diet diversity associated with higher precipitation. In West Africa, increasing rainfall appears to counterbalance the effect of rising temperature impacts on diet diversity. In some regions, the statistical effect of climate on diet diversity is comparable to, or greater than, other common development efforts including those focused on education, improved water and toilets, and poverty reduction. These results suggest that warming temperatures and increasing rainfall variability could have profound short- and long-term impacts on child diet diversity, potentially undermining widespread development interventions aimed at improving food security.},

	abstract = {Objective
This study aimed to present an overview of the association between dietary diversity ({DDiv}) and growth outcomes (stunting, wasting, and underweight) in children aged {\textless} 5 years.
Design
This systematic review was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines.
Setting and Participants
{PubMed}, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar databases were searched up to February, 2021, using relevant keywords as follows: “Dietary diversity or diet diversity or food diversity or diet variety or dietary variety or food variety,” “under-nutrition or stunting or wasting or underweight or nutritional status,” and “children or infants.” Original articles published in English were eligible for this review. Newcastle-Ottawa scales and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool were used to assess the quality and risk of bias of the articles.
Main Outcome Measures, Analysis, and Results
Totally, 81 articles (70 cross-sectional, 4 longitudinal cohort, 5 case-control, and 2 randomized controlled trials) were included in this review. Of the studies, 45 focused on infants and 36 on children aged {\textless} 5 years. The reviewed articles had good quality and low risk of bias (scores {\textgreater} 6). In infants, low {DDiv} was associated with stunting, wasting, and being underweight (79\%, 57\%, and 68\% of the studies, respectively). Among children aged {\textless} 5 years, the association was observed in 75\%, 56\%, and 57\% of the studies, respectively, for stunting, wasting, and underweight.
Conclusions and Implications
The findings indicate a possible association between low {DDiv} of infants and children aged {\textless} 5 years with stunting. However, this association remained uncertain with wasting and being underweight.},

	abstract = {Simple indicators reflecting diet quality for young children are needed both for programs and in some research contexts. Measures of dietary diversity are relatively simple and were shown to be associated with nutrient adequacy and nutritional status. However, dietary diversity also tends to increase with income and wealth; thus, the association between dietary diversity and child nutrition may be confounded by socioeconomic factors. We used data from 11 recent Demographic and Health Surveys ({DHS}) to examine the association between dietary diversity and height-for-age Z-scores ({HAZ}) for children 6–23 mo old, while controlling for household wealth/welfare and several other potentially confounding factors. Bivariate associations between dietary diversity and {HAZ} were observed in 9 of the 11 countries. Dietary diversity remained significant as a main effect in 7 countries in multivariate models, and interacted significantly with other factors (e.g., child age, breast-feeding status, urban/rural location) in 3 of the 4 remaining countries. Thus, dietary diversity was significantly associated with {HAZ}, either as a main effect or in an interaction, in all but one of the countries analyzed. These findings suggest that there is an association between child dietary diversity and nutritional status that is independent of socioeconomic factors, and that dietary diversity may indeed reflect diet quality. Before dietary diversity can be recommended for widespread use as an indicator of diet quality, additional research is required to confirm and clarify relations between various dietary diversity indicators and nutrient intake, adequacy, and density, for children with differing dietary patterns.},

	abstract = {Correct dietary patterns are important for a child’s health from birth to adulthood. Understanding a child’s health as a state of entire physical, mental, and social well-being is essential. However, reaching adulthood in a complete health proper state is determined by feeding and dietary habits during preconception, pregnancy, or children infancy. Different factors, such as the mother’s lifestyle, culture, or socioeconomic status, are crucial during all these phases. In this review, we aimed to assess the long-term associations between infancy dietary patterns and health and their influence on development and growth. To reach this objective, a consensus critical review was carried out using primary sources such as scientific articles, and secondary bibliographic indexes, databases, and web pages. {PubMed}, {SciELO}, and Google Scholar were the tools used to complete this research. We found that high-income countries promote high-calorie foods and, consequently, obesity problems among children are rising. However, undernutrition is a global health issue concerning children in low- and middle-income countries; thus, parental socioeconomic status in early life is essential to children’s health and development, showing that biological, social, and environmental influences are increased risk factors for chronic diseases. This narrative review is aimed to collect evidence for early nutritional intervention and future disease prevention.},
