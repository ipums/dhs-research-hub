Long term shifts in weather patterns have created both chronic and acute
changes in growing conditions in many parts of the world. By altering
food production and access, these shifts can produce long-term impacts
on the lives, biology, and behavior of the subsistence farmers,
agriculturalists, and pastoralist residents who rely on specific
environmental conditions to support their livelihoods.

These effects are especially pronounced in low-income countries on the
front lines of climate change. Beyond merely the choices of when to
plant, water, and harvest, research consistently demonstrates that
growing conditions—and by extension, food access and availability—play a
key role in migration decisions, livelihood selection and
diversification, health outcomes, resource related conflict, and the
choice of whether, when and how often to have children. Because of this,
data on immediate and longitudinal growing conditions are at the heart
of social and climate scientists' understanding of the link between
climate change and health, particularly among the most vulnerable and
poorest regions and populations.

# Measuring Growing Conditions

Chief among the tools for assessing immediate and longitudinal changes
in growing conditions is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or
**NDVI**. Developed in 1973, NDVI is based on remotely sensed imagery
and is calculated using the amount of red light (which vegetation
largely absorbs) and near-infrared light (which vegetation strongly
reflects). The NDVI value for a given pixel of an image is the ratio of
the *difference* between the near-infrared and red bands relative to the
*sum* of the same two bands. This ratio provides a useful measure of
vegetation quantity, density, and quality that can serve as a useful
proxy for local growing conditions that takes into account the synergy
between temperature and precipitation at a fine-grained spatial
resolution.

On its own, NDVI provides insights into the amount of food in a location
of interest—notably over time (when compared to itself) or space (when
compared to surrounding regions). Figure 1 shows how the NDVI
distribution varies not only across regions, but also across growing
seasons within those regions—and that season-to-season differences are
themselves more variable in certain regions than others. When used in
conjunction with population-level data, this variability in NDVI can
help researchers to understand the biological and behavioral responses
to either lean periods or periods of relative abundance.

# NDVI in Context

In order for NDVI to be most useful, researchers need to attend to both
contextual factors and the pathways linking greenness to food
production.

For example, despite providing a useful proxy for growing conditions,
NDVI cannot tell us how much of a green space comprises edible crops, as
opposed to cash crops, weeds and other fallow lands, or forests. As
such, areas with dense vegetation may show up as having high NDVI values
despite a relative lack of edible crops.

Moreover, NDVI is spatially and temporally rich, so the ways in which
NDVI is aggregated and reported can have a significant impact on the
degree to which NDVI values align with food production and crop yields.
These decisions are context-dependent, and require knowledge of local
landscapes and livelihoods. For instance, regions that are characterized
by abundant natural vegetation that must be cleared to make room for
cultivated consumable crops may have higher annual averages and peak
NDVI—but may not yield any more food than regions characterized by lower
annual or peak NDVI.

Scientists continue to develop different strategies to identify
agriculture versus non-agriculture when using NDVI and strategies for
this are somewhat place-dependent. The situation may also be complicated
by the *types* of naturally occurring vegetation—yet another feature
unaccounted for by NDVI. Thus, contextual knowledge is paramount to
understanding the how local communities may use naturally occurring
vegetation. In an ongoing qualitative study of risk and protective
factors associated with acute child malnutrition in East Africa,
researchers from our team interviewed field experts in Africa who
reported that resilient mothers may forgo use of locally available and
naturally occurring food sources in times of abundance, but would
harvest those crops to buffer against hunger in lean periods (please

This research also highlighted the importance of understanding the
biological and behavioral pathways that link greenness to conflict,
health, and population outcomes. Often these pathways can work in
diametrically opposing directions. In their 2023 paper on seasonal
variability in NDVI and its impacts on women’s childbearing goals in
three African countries, Brooks and colleagues found that higher NDVI
values were associated with an *increase* in fertility intentions and a
*decrease* in modern contraceptive use.[@brooks2023investigating]
Authors interpreted results to indicate that women changed their
behaviors in response to early signals of growing season quality.

These findings echo a paper by Grace and colleagues (2017) which showed
a consistent pattern under different conditions: when faced with
episodes of food insecurity, women reported less desire to get pregnant,
increased marital conflict, and less willingness to
breastfeed.[@grace2017qualitative] Yet, while high greenness may
positively impact fertility aspirations (or low greenness may suppress
them), research has shown that periods of abundance may also increase
labor demands for women and pregnant women, leading to higher incidence
of miscarriage and thus driving down fertility.[@randell2021climatic;
@bakhtsiyarava2018climate] Clearly, the pathways that link NDVI to
various health outcomes are not straightforward, and teasing them out
often requires qualitative study and stakeholder engagement.

NDVI provides an invaluable tool for understanding how climate change
impacts food production with implications for health and health-related
behaviors. Yet in order to make best use of NDVI, it is imperative to
understand the decisions in measurement and quantification of local
vegetation, how that relates to food production, and the pathways
linking food production to biology and behavior change.
