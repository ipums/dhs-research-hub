There have been heroic efforts to produce thorough, high-quality,
publicly available climate data, which has provided new opportunities
for researchers interested in climate demography. The wealth of climate
resources we now have provide solid, well-organized, and fine-grained
data on temperatures and rainfall and how these conditions vary over
time. What is more challenging is getting the personal histories from
surveys to line up with those data.

If researchers are interested in the relationship between climate and
reproductive issues such as contraceptive use, sexual activity, and
fertility preferences, data analysis can be relatively straightforward.
Questions answered at the time of the survey give us this current
information. We know where respondents live at the time of the survey
and when the survey took place, so space and time are easily addressed.

If we want to unravel how climate might influence reproductive events,
such as pregnancies, we need to look back across time at what happened,
when, and where. This post addresses some common limitations and issues
that can be tricky to work with when aligning climate and reproductive
health data longitudinally.

Some of our focus below is on analyzing pregnancy history data collected
prior to DHS Phase 8. For surveys from DHS Phase 8 forward (released
after 2023), when pregnancy histories were routinely collected,
analyzing reproductive events over time may be more straightforward. But
any analysis of reproductive events using longitudinal data must grapple
with issues related to migration, defining the period at risk of fetal
loss, and making sound choices about covariates, all topics discussed in
this post.

# Why look at reproductive histories and climate?

Research at the intersection of climate and reproductive health has
already demonstrated important and concerning issues. In general, we
know that rainfall and temperature conditions influence birth
rates.[@bdg18; @s17; @sg19] Underlying this finding, however, are many
distinct processes we are only beginning to understand. Weather can
influence whether pregnancies are carried to term[@bs20] and increase
the risk of miscarriage.[@ddg20; @sackfl21] Weather may also affect
whether pregnancies happen, as we know thermal stress from heat can
reduce fecundity.[@bdg18; @mfy17]

Beyond these direct, immediate effects, climate and weather events may
have longer-term, indirect influences on reproductive health and
outcomes. Food insecurity and infectious disease prevalence are both
influenced by heat and rainfall and can impact women’s reproductive
health.[@ddg20; @d15; @d19] Birth spacing can shift depending on how
breastfeeding is impacted by weather.[@rgb21]

If we consider individual agency, climate and weather may change
childbearing preferences, including ideal family size.[@ets19] When
agricultural production or labor needs shift in response to weather and
climate, resources and income are affected, which can shape the demand
for children.[@c06; @mgbp00] Libido may decline in response to hotter
temperatures.[@lm96; @waj17] Adaptation strategies to weather may also
increase physical labor, which can reduce short-term
fecundity.[@ecbbdhj21; @ha97; @p96; @vshr94]

In sum, the pathways through which reproductive histories are affected
by weather and climate are remarkably varied, and we have only begun to
map these pathways.

# What we need

When looking at factors that influence events over a reproductive life
course, we can think in terms of time to an event, where we need to fill
in the blanks before the event. The event of interest could be menarche,
conception, a pregnancy outcome, or menopause. Along with having
information about past pregnancies and births, for example, we need to
know where women lived and, consequently, what they were exposed to,
during the time preceding these events.

Getting the exposure correct is key to systematic and rigorous
longitudinal analysis. We must ensure we are aligning individual and
climate/weather data at the exact right moment in time and space. This
alignment is generally facilitated through GPS location information
provided at the level of the community at the time of the survey. But
what happens if someone has not been living in that community long?
Because we cannot correctly assign climate data before an individual
moved to their location at the survey date, we must know something about
the person’s residential history and adjust our sample
accordingly.[@gb20]

::: column-margin
Note that "exact" is relative. We do not need exact home addresses;
rather, we need an idea of the environmental conditions around where
people lived and worked. The spatial detail around this information
varies according to the population-environment process we are
investigating, just as the detail in the health survey data varies.
:::

Besides having GPS location and knowing length of time at that location,
we need full reproductive histories. Ideally, we want information about
pregnancies as well as about the timing of live births. Knowing when a
pregnancy began and ended (even if not in a live birth), as well as the
nature of the ending, is essential for sorting out the different factors
that link climate change and reproductive health.

# What is available in DHS

The [Demographic and Health Surveys](https://www.dhsprogram.com/data/)
(DHS) remain the best source of individual- and household-level health
data for poor and middle-income countries. The scope of the DHS program
and the consistency of this survey enables standardization of results,
which is key for comparing and generalizing findings.

In addition, The DHS Program has made some key decisions that increased
the surveys’ usefulness to climate and health researchers. First, DHS
began providing GPS coordinates that allow researchers to match climate
measures to low-level locations (e.g., the approximate site of a village
where the sample was drawn). Second, the survey began to collect
information on how long individuals have resided at their current
location. Many of us dream of full migration histories being collected
by DHS, which would help us deal with bias caused by climate migration.
At the moment, we have to assume that those who stayed were least
affected by past weather events and climate shifts. Nevertheless, with
information about the person’s length of time at their current
residence, we can at least be sure we are correctly assigning the
contextual measures to a location for the right amount of time.

These two pieces of information—GPS coordinates for the primary sampling
unit and respondents’ length of time at their current residence—are not
available in all DHS datasets. Although most recent data sets have this
information, researchers must check whether older samples have variables
such as `V104` (`RESIDEINTYR` in IPUMS DHS), which reports how many
years a woman has lived in her place of residence.

The narrowest time intervals available in DHS data are generally months
and years. For example, we have the month and year of birth for all
women of childbearing age and for their offspring. We also have
information on time of moving to the current location and on the date of
the woman’s first cohabiting union. For data on reproductive events, DHS
surveys conform to one of two types:

1.  **Live birth histories:** The year and month of each live birth to a
    woman is collected.

    This information is recorded regardless of whether the child is
    still alive and whether the child lives with the mother. Although
    the birth history collection strategy misses pregnancies that do not
    lead to a live birth, it is superior to the common strategy in
    surveys and census sources of only documenting the ages of children
    in the household. Most DHS surveys from Phases 1 through 7 only
    collected birth histories from women of childbearing age.

2.  **Pregnancy histories:** The year and month of every pregnancy
    outcome is collected.

    Pregnancy histories are more complete than live birth histories
    because they also capture any known conception that ends in a
    miscarriage, abortion, or stillbirth. Whether the specific outcomes
    of miscarriage, abortion or stillbirth are distinguished varies
    across these samples, with abortions and miscarriages commonly
    combined into one category.

These two types of histories relate to the entire life of the woman.
Until recently, fewer than 25 DHS surveys collected pregnancy histories.
For DHS Phase 8 (with data distributed around 2023 or later), a
pregnancy history rather than just a birth history was included the
standard questionnaire that serves as the starting point for each
country’s survey.

Besides the birth history or pregnancy history data, the DHS often
collects monthly reproductive history data for women for the five years
preceding a survey. The simplest 5-year reproductive calendars only
report whether a woman experienced a birth, pregnancy, or pregnancy
termination in each month. Most reproductive calendars also collect
monthly information on family planning, including the type of
contraception used and, often, the reason for its discontinuation.
Combined with other information that situates the last five years in a
woman’s reproductive history, the calendar data can be a rich resource.
IPUMS DHS has made it easier to analyse calendar data, through providing
integrated variables accessed by choosing "Woman month" as the unit of
analysis.

But for maximum statistical power, which quickly becomes important when
working with covariates and splitting the data into comparison groups,
and to avoid left truncation of data (not knowing when contraceptive use
or a pregnancy began), full birth or pregnancy histories are often
preferable. The rest of this post focuses on strategies for working with
full reproductive histories.

# Making it work

## Defining the window of observation

The first step is establishing the window of observation, that is, the
time period when we know a woman is living at her current location. In
the absence of detailed migration histories, we can begin this
observation period with the exact month and year she moved to her
current place of residence (when such detail is available).
Alternatively, we can choose a standard reference period, such as the
first January following the year she moved to her location. Since the
most commonly available DHS migration variable covers "Years lived in
place of residence" (`V104`/`RESIDEINTYR`), this last approach is often
the most practical. Although we do not analyse births or pregnancies
before that starting point, these unobserved events are used when
creating information about the woman, such as parity or years since last
birth/pregnancy outcome. For women who reported "always" living in their
current location, the full reproductive history can be analyzed (i.e.,
events from age 15 until the time of interview).

Once the window of observation is constructed for each individual, and
the sample selected to include only those observations, then climate
data can be merged on to the unit of analysis (i.e., woman or woman
month).

## Defining the timing of a pregnancy

A particularly salient period during which climate and environment can
affect reproduction is the time between conception and the end of a
pregnancy. When working with live births, including data from the widely
available DHS birth histories, the conception month is usually
calculated by subtracting 9 months from the date of birth.

When working with pregnancy history data, the situation is sometimes
more complicated. DHS samples with pregnancy histories always report the
year and month a pregnancy ended. For this blog post, we focus on the 22
standard DHS surveys that collected pregnancy history data before (the
current) Phase 8 survey. The Phase 8 approach is very different than the
pre-Phase 8 approach and as a result data analysis approaches will need
to be different. Strategies to use both the pre-phase 8 and the phase 8
data are useful to allow for longer-term investigations of climate
impacts on pregnancy.

For the pre-Phase 8 data, the variable names relating to pregnancy
history are sample-specific. In general, country- and year-specific
variable names in DHS women’s surveys begin with the letter `s` followed
by the number of the relevant question on the questionnaire. Thus, for
example, on the women’s questionnaire for the 2012-2013 Pakistan sample,
question number 226 records the month and year that each pregnancy
ended. Accordingly, variables `s226m_XX` and `s226y_XX` respectively
report "Month of pregnancy lost" and "Year of pregnancy lost," with `XX`
referencing the number of the pregnancy, from the most recent (`01`) to
the twentieth most recent.

Figuring out the date of conception for pregnancies in pre-Phase 8
pregnancy histories can be difficult. Some of these surveys, such as the
Pakistan 2012-13 sample, directly asked how long the pregnancy lasted.
For many of the samples with early pregnancy histories, particularly
from Eastern Europe and East Asia, this direct information about
pregnancy duration (and thus conception date) is lacking.

In such cases, establishing the month of conception based on the month
of miscarriage, abortion or stillbirth requires imputation. Knowing the
month of conception is required for investigating climate impacts on
pregnancy outcomes. One approach uses information derived from the
five-year calendar data.[@bgb24] In those data one can observe the month
a woman said she was pregnant and the month when the pregnancy ended. By
taking the difference, we can get an estimate of how long pregnancies
lasted on average before the specific outcome in a specific culture. We
can also calculate the mean and standard deviation for pregnancy
outcomes for a given calendar sample and use those statistics as a
structure for imputation. Note that reports from the calendar data may
be sensitive to context—for example, the extent to which stillbirths are
called miscarriages and vice versa. In addition, the length of gestation
before abortion may vary by abortion legislation, which obviously varies
across time and space. Thus, no clear rules of thumb, like "pregnancies
ending in a live birth usually last 9 months," can be stated for
pregnancies ending in miscarriage, stillbirth, or abortion. Such
estimates for terminated pregnancies should be context-specific (e.g.,
access to pregnancy tests) and empirically grounded.

Results from calendar-based imputed pregnancy duration data for one
study are shown in Table 1, which details the pregnancy outcome timing
from Armenian and Tajik DHS data.[@bgb24] Only 65% of reported
pregnancies ended in a live birth in Armenia during the five years
preceding the survey (2015-16) and 84% in Tajikistan (2017). To impute
the timing of conceptions ending in stillbirth, miscarriage, or
abortion, the authors applied a normal (Gaussian) distribution using the
mean and standard deviation observed in the five-year calendar data
within the specific DHS data set.

## Selecting appropriate covariates

A final consideration when working with retrospective longitudinal data
is which variables can be used as covariates. Unless information comes
in the form of histories, where we can track changes in a characteristic
for an individual over time, we should only use information that does
not change. Examples of non-changing variables are birth cohort and
ethnicity/nationality.

The DHS provides a wealth of household and individual-level information
that is unfortunately problematic when analyzing climate effects over
time. This is generally unsatisfying, since we know socioeconomic
factors play an important role in health outcomes. But ascribing back
characteristics—such as household wealth quintile, woman’s employment
status, her contraceptive knowledge, or her decision-making power at the
time the survey—to the respondent earlier in time is risking a few
problems. First, such ascription introduces error into the data, whereby
a characteristic is assigned at a time for which it may not be true.
Although it may seem relevant that the person eventually ended up with
that characteristic, assigning the characteristic before it is true
introduces estimation inconsistencies due to "anticipatory
analyses".[@hk06]

While assuming that current characteristics held earlier is never
completely reliable, error could be minimized by restricting analysis to
recent pregnancies—for example, those occurring in the three years
before the survey or focusing on only the most-recent and
second-most-recent pregnancies (indexed `_01` and `_02`), if they occurred
recently.

One option for gaining some measure of socioeconomic status that varies
over time is to construct time-varying covariate variables. For example,
from the variable that tells us the woman’s completed number of years of
education (`V133`, or `EDYRTOTAL` in IPUMS DHS), we can produce a
reasonable estimate of her last year in school. We can code the
following years according to the highest level of education the
respondent achieved. Similarly, we do not have partnership histories in
DHS, but we do know the woman’s age at her first marriage or coresident
union (`V511`, or `AGEFRSTMAR` in IPUMS DHS). From this information, we
can construct a time-varying covariate for whether the woman had ever
entered a co-resident union.

# Conclusion

Some of the pathways by which climate change affects health relate to
reproductive events such as pregnancies and births. Analyzing such
events over the life of a woman demands care on the part of researchers.
One must, for example, "define the window of observation," by excluding
reproductive events that occurred before a woman migrated to her survey
location. One must choose the type of longitudinal reproductive data:
calendar data from the previous five years, birth history data, or
pregnancy history data from across the woman’s life. Pregnancy history
data in the IR (women’s) files from before and after DHS Phase 8 differ
in variable naming conventions and scope. While dates for the end of
pregnancies are consistently known, determining month of conception may
need to rely on data imputation for some pre-Phase 8 samples. Covariates
should reflect time-invariant characteristics, be restricted unless
analyzing very recent pregnancies, or be constructed to reflect
variation over time (e.g., in educational attainment).

Climate change and health research yields valid conclusions only when we
avoid glaring errors—for example, assuming that environmental conditions
were the same in a woman’s previous location as in her current
residence, or that current characteristics (e.g., employment, household
wealth) were static across time. We hope this post helps researchers
avoid such errors and guides them in solving problems that arise with
retrospective longitudinal reproductive histories.
