Unpacking the relationship between weather extremes and health requires
not only technical skills, but also a strong theoretical foundation.
Extreme weather, health, and their relationships are all complex.
Researchers begin by conceptualizing—for their specific questions—1) the
nature of the extreme weather event, 2) the details of the health outcome, and
3) the temporal and spatial relationships between extreme weather and the health 
phenomena of interest.

Beyond these three elements, contextual factors are crucial for
identifying the complex causal pathways among weather extremes and health.
Figure 1 illustrates how the pathway from an extreme weather event, its
manifestation in the environment, and its impact on various health
outcomes is embedded within larger contexts. As suggested by the gray
box on the right, individuals will be impacted by extreme weather in
unique ways based on their demographic characteristics and social
determinants that affect their lived experiences. The gray box on the
left illustrates how environmental and institutional contexts will also
influence relationships between extreme weather events and health. Contexts
influence the impact of exposures on individuals as well as their
mitigation and adaptation strategies in response to extreme weather risks.

## Building a conceptual model

Below, we provide the steps in creating a tailored conceptual model for
research on extreme weather and health.

### 1. Assessing the temporal and spatial nature of extreme weather risk

Risks arising from weather extremes vary in their temporal and spatial
scales. In terms of timing, risks may be acute or protracted. Acute
risks arise when one-time exposure to an extreme weather event is sufficient to
trigger health outcomes, for example, when flooding makes water unsafe
for drinking. Protracted risks, in contrast, arise from sustained
exposure to extreme weather, such as the inhalation of dust over the
course of enduring dry periods. The impact of extreme weather is also
spatially variable. While some events affect wide areas, others’
scope is limited to discrete locations. Determining the type of risk
depends on both the nature of the extreme weather event and the health outcome
studied. Identifying the temporal and spatial dimensions of risk provide
the basis for decisions concerning temporal aggregation of environmental data,
as well as the length of expected lags between initial exposure to an
extreme weather event and the manifestation of the health outcome.

### 2. Incorporating social and behavioral context

Certain extreme weather events are known to have deleterious effects on humans.
For example, exposure to extremely high temperatures during the first
trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of low birth-weight babies.
[@Grace2021] Basic biological truths such as this are insufficient,
however, to fully assess the impact of extreme weather on individual
health because individuals have dramatically different access to
resources, opportunities, and constraints. A pregnant person who lives
in an air-conditioned house will experience extreme temperatures very
differently than a person who is houseless. Demographic characteristics,
such as age, gender, wealth, and partnership status matter when
assessing the impacts of weather extremes.

Furthermore, the characteristics of societies (e.g., rural versus urban,
gender roles, livelihoods) matter. Consider rising temperatures in
nomadic versus other types of communities.[@Grace2017] For both,
temperature change may make it harder to access water. In nomadic
communities, the result could be men driving herds further from the
community and thus staying away longer, while in other communities, the
result could be that children tasked with collecting water find the task
more physically demanding. Who and how individuals are affected by water
shortages will vary depending on community norms and roles. Community
characteristics will also affect the instigation and nature of
mitigation and adaptation efforts. While analyses that map the nature of
extreme weather over time provide a useful starting point, they cannot
fully capture the individual- and community-specific impacts of extreme
weather.[@Grace2017]

### 3. Understanding environmental and institutional contexts

Environmental and institutional contexts are also influential in shaping
causal pathways between weather extremes and health. The physical
environment, such as altitude and the demarcation of seasons, can
provide some level of protection from some extreme weather events. For
instance, a small reduction in annual rainfall can have a devastating
effect in an arid location where there is a close correspondence between
a rainy season and agricultural production.[@Dorelien2023] The same
reduction in rainfall might have only a minor impact in a location where
annual precipitation is diffused throughout the year and is less closely
tied to the agricultural season. Understanding such differences is
important for selecting accurate measurements. In the former location,
the rain shortfall might best be measured through the length of the
rainy season. In the latter location, considering rainfall deviation
from a monthly or annual average could be more
appropriate.[@Dorelien2023]

Institutional contexts include the built environment, such as the
presence of roads, wells, and irrigation systems, as well as
organizations designed to facilitate human capabilities, such as
political, healthcare, and education systems. Local governments’
capacities to intervene to protect populations faced with risks of extreme 
weather can reduce negative health outcomes. Healthcare systems affect the
accessibility of treatment (both physically and financially), while
education systems provide individuals with the knowledge of when and how
to respond to weather events. Extreme weather and health research that
fails to capture these contextual effects can lead to faulty
conclusions.

## Conclusion

Theorizing the core relationship among specific extreme weather events and
specific health outcomes is the first step in developing a conceptual
model but is insufficient to fully capture complex causal pathways.
Individual characteristics, social determinants of health, and
environmental and institutional environments are also critical. Informed
and clearly identified spatial and temporal measurement of environmental
exposures is necessary, and these exposures should be thoughtfully,
appropriately, and explicitly linked to the particular health outcomes
of interest. Community-focused expertise and stakeholder engagement is
vital to fully understand and incorporate how broader contexts interact
with local circumstances to uniquely influence how weather extremes are
experienced.
