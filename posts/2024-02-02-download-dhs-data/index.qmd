[The Demographic and Health Surveys Program](https://dhsprogram.com/)
(DHS) is the leading source of population health data for low- and
middle-income countries around the world. [IPUMS
DHS](https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs/) disseminates a harmonized version
of the DHS survey results in which variables are integrated across time
and space, facilitating comparative and longitudinal analysis.
Furthermore, IPUMS DHS provides a web interface and streamlined
documentation to make the data discovery and download process easier.

# Accessing the data

To obtain access to IPUMS DHS data, you must first [request data
access](https://dhsprogram.com/data/new-user-registration.cfm) from the
DHS Program. Once you've done so, you can use your username and password
from DHS to log in to IPUMS DHS.

## Browse data

Users can browse the available data using the IPUMS DHS [data selection
interface](https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs-action/variables/group), which
includes sample and variable availability, descriptions, codes, and
more.

For more information about how to use the interface, see the IPUMS DHS
[user guide](https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs/user_guide.shtml).

## Select data

Once you've selected the samples and variables you want to include in
your data extract, click **View Cart** to review your selections. If
you're satisfied with the contents of your extract, click **Create Data
Extract**.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| column: body-outset
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-align: center

knitr::include_graphics("images/dhs-download1.png")
```

IPUMS DHS allows you to select one of several output file formats. On
this blog, we will use the default *fixed-width* (.dat) file option,
which is the format expected by the data-reading functions provided in
ipumsr.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| column: body-outset
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-align: center

knitr::include_graphics("images/dhs-download2.png")
```

Click **Submit Extract** to submit your extract for processing on the
IPUMS servers. You'll receive an email when your extract is complete and
ready to download.

## Download data

Click the green download button to download the compressed data file for
your extract.

You will also need to download an associated metadata (DDI) file. This
is an XML file that contains parsing instructions for the fixed-width
data file as well as descriptive information about the variables
contained in an extract.

::: column-margin
DDI stands for [Data Documentation
Initiative](https://ddialliance.org/), an international standard for
documenting data obtained in survey research.
:::

You can do so by right clicking the **DDI** link and selecting **Save
link as...**.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| column: page
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-align: center

knitr::include_graphics("images/microdata_annotated_screenshot.png")
```

::: callout-tip
The specific text included in the dropdown may differ based on the
browser that you are using. For instance, Safari displays the option
**Download Linked File As...**.

The important thing is that you download the DDI file in **.xml**
format, *not* .html format.

# Load IPUMS DHS data into R

The `{ipumsr}` package provides the tools you'll need to easily load
your extract into R.

::: column-margin
`r hex("ipumsr")`
:::

If you haven't previously installed the package, you can do so with:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("ipumsr")
```

To load your data, use `read_ipums_micro()`. If your data file and DDI
file are in the same directory, you can load the data by providing only
the DDI file path. To be safe, we typically provide the path to both
files.

Note that you'll need to adjust the file paths to reflect the location
of the files on your local system.

```{r}
library(ipumsr)

dhs <- read_ipums_micro(
  ddi = "data/dhs/idhs_00015.xml",
  data_file = "data/dhs/idhs_00015.dat.gz",
)
```

You should now have a tabular data source loaded into R:

```{r}
dhs
```

### Why use ipumsr?

Several R packages already exist for reading external data files. There
are a few reasons we suggest using ipumsr to work with IPUMS data.

#### Load compressed files

First, IPUMS delivers data extracts as compressed archives. ipumsr
anticipates this and allows you to load data directly without having to
manually decompress these files.

#### View variable metadata

Furthermore, ipumsr uses the metadata contained in an extract's DDI file
to attach contextual information to the loaded data. For instance, to
get a description of a variable contained in an extract, use
`ipums_var_label()`:

```{r}
ipums_var_label(dhs$HWHAZWHO)
```

Use `ipums_val_labels()` to check if there are any labeled values in the
data for that variable. Labeled values typically represent categories
(for non-continuous variables) or contain information about the codes
used for missing values.

For `HWHAZWHO`, several values represent different types of missing
data. (You will likely want to convert these values to `NA` before
conducting an analysis using this variable!)

```{r}
ipums_val_labels(dhs$HWHAZWHO)
```

More details about working with IPUMS metadata can be found in the
[ipumsr
documentation](https://tech.popdata.org/ipumsr/articles/value-labels.html).

#### Access the IPUMS API

Finally, ipumsr provides an R interface for the IPUMS API, allowing you
to request and download data entirely within your R environment. While
these features do not currently support IPUMS DHS, work on the API is
ongoing, so you may be able to access IPUMS DHS data in the future! To
see more about the projects that are currently supported by the IPUMS
API, check out the [API
documentation](https://developer.ipums.org/docs/v2/apiprogram/).

See the [API
introduction](https://tech.popdata.org/ipumsr/articles/ipums-api.html)
to learn how to use ipumsr to interact with the IPUMS API.
