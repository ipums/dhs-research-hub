   abstract = {WMO-recommended 30-yr normals are no longer generally useful for the design, planning, and decision-making purposes for which they were intended. They not only have little relevance to the future climate, but are often unrepresentative of the current climate. The reason for this is rapid global climate change over the last 30 yr that is likely to continue into the future. It is demonstrated that simple empirical alternatives already are available that not only produce reasonably accurate normals for the current climate but also often justify their extrapolation to several years into the future. This result is tied to the condition that recent trends in the climate are approximately linear or have a substantial linear component. This condition is generally satisfied for the U.S. climate-division data. One alternative [the optimal climate normal (OCN)] is multiyear averages that are not fixed at 30 yr like WMO normals are but rather are adapted climate record by climate record based on easily estimated characteristics of the records. The OCN works well except with very strong trends or longer extrapolations with more moderate trends. In these cases least squares linear trend fits to the period since the mid-1970s are viable alternatives. An even better alternative is the use of "hinge fit" normals, based on modeling the time dependence of large-scale climate change. Here, longer records can be exploited to stabilize estimates of modern trends. Related issues are the need to avoid arbitrary trend fitting and to account for trends in studies of ENSO impacts. Given these results, the authors recommend that (a) the WMO and national climate services address new policies for changing climate normals using the results here as a starting point and (b) NOAA initiate a program for improved estimates and forecasts of official U.S. normals, including operational implementation of a simple hybrid system that combines the advantages of both the OCN and the hinge fit. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

@article{Grace2021,
   abstract = {The goal of this article is to consider data solutions to investigate the differential pathways that connect climate/ weather variability to child health outcomes. We apply several measures capturing different aspects of climate/ weather variability to different time periods of in utero exposure. The measures are designed to capture the complexities of climate- related risks and isolate their impacts based on the timing and duration of exposure. Specifically, we focus on infant birth weight in Mali and consider local weather and environmental conditions associated with the three most frequently posited potential drivers of adverse health outcomes: disease (malaria), heat stress, and food insecurity. We focus this study on Mali, where seasonal trends facilitate the use of measures specifically designed to capture distinct aspects of climate/ weather conditions relevant to the potential drivers. Results indicate that attention to the timing of exposures and employing measures designed to capture nuances in each of the drivers provides important insight into climate and birth weight outcomes, especially in the case of factors impacted by precipitation. Results also indicate that high temperatures and low levels of agricultural production are consistently associated with lower birth weights, and exposure to malarious conditions may increase likelihood of nonlive birth outcomes.},

@article{Funk2019,
   abstract = {Understanding the dynamics and physics of climate extremes will be a critical challenge for twenty-first-century climate science. Increasing temperatures and saturation vapor pressures may exacerbate heat waves, droughts, and precipitation extremes. Yet our ability to monitor temperature variations is limited and declining. Between 1983 and 2016, the number of observations in the University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit (CRU) Tmax product declined precipitously (5900 / 1000); 1000 poorly distributed measurements are insufficient to resolve regional Tmax variations. Here, we show that combining long (1983 to the near present), high-resolution (0.058), cloud-screened archives of geostationary satellite thermal infrared (TIR) observations with a dense set of;15 000 station observations explains 23%, 40%, 30%, 41%, and 1% more variance than the CRU globally and for South America, Africa, India, and areas north of 508N, respectively; even greater levels of improvement are shown for the 2011–16 period (28%, 45%, 39%, 52%, and 28%, respectively). Described here for the first time, the TIR Tmax algorithm uses subdaily TIR distributions to screen out cloud-contaminated observations, providing accurate (correlation'0.8) gridded emission Tmax estimates. Blending these gridded fields with;15 000 station observations provides a seamless, high-resolution source of accurate Tmax estimates that performs well in areas lacking dense in situ observations and even better where in situ observations are available. Cross-validation results indicate that the satellite-only, station-only, and combined products all perform accurately (R' 0.8–0.9, mean absolute errors' 0.8–1.0). Hence, the Climate Hazards Center Infrared Temperature with Stations (CHIRTSmax) dataset should provide a valuable resource for climate change studies, climate extreme analyses, and early warning applications.},
