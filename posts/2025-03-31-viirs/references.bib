   abstract = {In this study, the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) land surface temperature (LST) environmental data record (EDR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) L2 swath LST products (collection 5) from both the Terra and Aqua satellites were evaluated against ground observations in an arid area of northwest China during the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) experiment. Four barren surface sites were chosen for the evaluation, which took place from June 2012 to April 2013. The results show that the current VIIRS LST products demonstrate a reasonable accuracy, with an average bias of 0.36. K and 0.58. K and an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.74. K and 1.48. K for the four sites during daytime and nighttime, respectively. The accuracy of the nighttime LST is much better than that of daytime. Furthermore, it was also found that the VIIRS split-window (SW) algorithm provides better performance than the VIIRS dual split-window (DSW) algorithm during both daytime and nighttime. For MODIS LST products, the results show that both Terra and Aqua MODIS C5 LST products underestimate the LST for the four barren surface sites at daytime, and the biases and RMSEs are much larger for Aqua, with biases varies from 0.91. K to 3.13. K for Terra and from 1.31. K to 3.76. K for Aqua. © 2013.},

@article{Roman2024,
   abstract = {This paper provides a review and summary status of the research underway by the NASA Terra Aqua Suomi-NPP Land Discipline Team to provide continuity of global land data products from the NASA Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The two MODIS instruments on the NASA Earth Observing System Terra (morning overpass) and Aqua (afternoon overpass) platforms have provided more than twenty years of data. The peer-reviewed land products generated from MODIS are now being transitioned to production using VIIRS inputs, with the intention of providing dynamic continuity for the Aqua observations. As part of that process, the products from the two instruments are undergoing intercomparison and evaluation. These results are provided where available and show promising levels of agreement and accuracy in all cases. The paper also offers options for establishing continuity of Terra MODIS data products.},
