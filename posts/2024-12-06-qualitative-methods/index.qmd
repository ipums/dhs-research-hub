Understanding how extreme weather conditions impact people and
communities is complex. Moreover, we're not only interested in the
*overall* impact of extreme weather on a population (for example, by
identifying where droughts or heat waves occur), but also in which
*groups* of people suffer disproportionately under these impacts. That
is, when a drought occurs in a given community, who within that
community experiences the most severe adverse outcomes?

Of course, we are also concerned with *why* these differences emerge. As
we’ve described in posts throughout this blog (for instance,
[here](../2024-06-11-climate-reproduction/),
[here](../2024-07-02-ndvi-concepts/), and
[here](../2024-02-23-rainfall-insights/)), answering this question
requires careful attention not only to the particular conditions of
place and of persons within that place, but also to the technical
details involved in spatial and temporal aggregation.

In other words, we must consider who a person is and how they live in
their space, and we must also design measures that capture variability
in exposures and conditions that make effective use of the data we have.

# A person-centered understanding of extreme weather impacts

Standard individual-level demographic variables (e.g., age, gender,
marital status, etc.) are commonly used to help identify variability in
extreme weather impacts and suffering. However, we can refine our
understanding of vulnerability by also considering factors related to
individual-level exposure and resources that might shape resilience and
recovery from a disaster.[@Dorelien2023; @Pinchoff2021]

## Measuring person-level factors in the DHS

In the [DHS](https://dhsprogram.com/), key measures that address an
individual's exposure are often their **length of time in current
residence** and **type of employment**. These measures help to provide
insight into what a person is used to dealing with and how sensitive
their livelihoods are to environmental events.

You can use [IPUMS DHS](https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs/) to browse groups
of variables related to a given topic, like
[residency](https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs-action/variables/group/geog_mig)
and
[employment](https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs-action/variables/group?id=ses_work).
:::

For example, in an area prone to inconsistent rainfall, an established
farmer who has lived there for the duration of their life is likely
accustomed to this variability and less susceptible to a poor rainfall
year than a farmer new to the community. The latter individual might
face greater risks in the event of a poor rainy season given their lack
of experience navigating or identifying those specific risks, normal to
that place.

However, both of these individuals are likely *more* susceptible to
adverse impacts on their lifestyles from a poor rainfall year than
individuals in the community with less dependence on rainfall to
generate food or income. Experience interacts with employment, as well:
a non-farmer who is a long-time resident of the community may identify
poor rainy conditions in very different ways than a farmer, regardless
of their experience navigating weather conditions in that community.

Thus, considering an individual's *time spent* living in a place
alongside *how* that individual lives and works in a place helps to
provide important information about why individual experiences vary in
response to extreme weather events.

# The importance of qualitative methods

The data from DHS and other related surveys help researchers sort out
categories of greater or lesser risk, but they are not able to provide
details on how those risks vary, why they vary, or the lived experience
of individuals. To access this kind of detail, we rely on qualitative
inquiry.[@Grace2019]

Qualitative investigations in the form of interviews, focus groups,
narrative accounts, and other strategies provide insight into the ways
people understand and experience extreme weather events. Considering
first-hand accounts of flooding in a given community, for example,
provides insight into how flooding is measured, what resources
individuals or households use to manage flooding risks, and also
specific aspects of flooding that trigger behavioral change.

In a small focus group-type discussion my colleagues and I organized
with humanitarian aid workers from several East African countries, where
we proposed the seemingly simple question: "How do you know when an area
has flooded?". In fact, we encourage any blog readers to consider this
question in their own lives. What is a flood in your community? At what
point would you encourage people (and which people) to leave their homes
or communities for safety? And at what point are you able to say that
the flood has reached disaster levels?

The purpose of these focus groups was to help the aid workers explicitly
identify the key criteria for measuring extreme weather impacts so they
could more effectively find relevant survey data—for instance, from
IPUMS DHS—that might address the risk factors associated with those
impacts. This, in turn, would allow them to make more informed decisions
when implementing interventions to improve health in the face of extreme
weather events.

IPUMS DHS and environmental data provide excellent sources of data to
quantify people’s experiences, but it is also important to understand
how extreme weather impacts people on the ground based on their lived
experiences. This is where qualitative investigations can come in to
support the development of appropriate and place-based quantitative
indicators capturing extreme weather risks and vulnerabilities.

The figure below highlights the importance of considering where a person
lives, who a person is—their age, their gender, marital status, health
status and so on—and how they interact with the landscape whenever
describing extreme weather impact and risk.

macro-level factors[@Reich2024]](images/flowchart.png){width="100%"}
:::

This kind of conceptual framework developed through qualitative research
can then be used to inform quantitative decisions in related analyses.

As we learned in our focus group discussion about floods, there is no
single definition for an extreme weather disaster or event that is
appropriate to use across individuals, communities, and times. This blog
and the data provided through IPUMS provide excellent opportunities to
create complex linked environment/health data sets, but the development
of place-based indicators of risk comes from attention to the lived
experiences of people on the ground.
