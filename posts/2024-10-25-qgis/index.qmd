Up to this point, this blog has used R to demonstrate spatial processing
and analysis techniques. We've
[emphasized](../2024-02-01-getting-started-with-r) some of the benefits
of using R, but it's far from the only software available for spatial
processing. Many spatial analysts instead rely on dedicated GIS
(Geographic Information Systems) software, which provide a
point-and-click interface for performing spatial analysis workflows.

In this post, we will use the open-source GIS software [QGIS (Quantum
GIS)](https://www.qgis.org/) to integrate environmental data with health
survey data. Using a case study from Kenya, we will combine monthly
temperature data from
[CHIRTS](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirtsmonthly) with geolocated
sample clusters from the [Demographic and Health Surveys
Program](https://dhsprogram.com/) (DHS). If you've been following along
with this blog, you'll recognize some similarities between this post and
[previous posts](../2024-02-04-dhs-chirps/). But while the spatial
analysis techniques will be familiar, the tools we use to implement them
will be new.

::: column-margin
[![](images/qgis.png)](https://www.qgis.org/)
:::

This step-by-step guide will provide an overview of QGIS and show you
how to import data, process raster data, create spatial buffers, and
extract aggregated data for analysis.

# Getting started with QGIS

QGIS is a powerful GIS software that allows us to visualize, analyze,
and edit spatial data. QGIS is an ideal choice for beginners and
advanced users alike because it combines a user-friendly interface with
powerful spatial processing capabilities. As is the case with R, QGIS is
open-source, meaning countless community resources, plugins, and
tutorials are available for new learners. This makes it a particularly
accessible and versatile tool for spatial analysis.

## Download and install QGIS

Follow the instructions on the [QGIS download
page](https://qgis.org/download/) to download the appropriate QGIS
version for your operating system. You have the option to select the
*Long Term Version* for stability or the *Latest Version* to gain access
to the newest features and updates.

## The QGIS interface

Once QGIS is installed, you’re ready to explore its interface and tools.
@fig-2 shows a screenshot of the main QGIS interface with some of the
main components highlighted.

1.  **Menu Bar:** Located at the top of the interface, the Menu Bar
    provides access to all functions and tools within QGIS, organized
    into categories like Project, Edit, View, Layer, Raster, Vector,
    Settings, etc. This is where we can access more advanced features,
    adjust settings, and manage our workspace.

2.  **Toolbar:** Directly below the Menu Bar, the Toolbar contains icons
    for many of the most frequently used tools in QGIS. Here, we’ll find
    quick access to functions like adding layers, zooming in and out,
    saving our project, and using geoprocessing tools. Each icon
    corresponds to a specific function, making it easy to perform
    actions without needing to navigate through menus.

3.  **Browser:** The Browser panel on the left helps us quickly access
    files and databases on our computer or connected servers. It’s
    similar to a file manager, allowing us to drag and drop data
    directly into the Map Window. If it’s not visible, you can enable it
    by selecting [View ‣ Panels ‣ Browser]{.menu-instr} in the toolbar.

4.  **Layers Panel:** The Layers Panel displays all the spatial layers
    that we’ve added to our current QGIS project. Each layer represents
    a different data source (e.g., country boundaries, temperature data,
    or health survey points). We can control the visibility of each
    layer, reorder them (by directly dragging them up or down), and
    change their styles directly from this panel. Right-clicking on a
    layer gives us additional options like opening the attribute table
    or adjusting the symbology. The visibility of layers on the Map
    Window depends on their position in this panel—make sure to keep the
    layer you want to visualize on top.

5.  **Map Window:** The Map Window is the central area where our spatial
    data is visually displayed. As we add, modify, and analyze data, the
    results are shown here. We can zoom in, zoom out, and pan across
    different parts of our map using tools from the toolbar or our
    mouse.

6.  **Information Bar:** At the bottom of the QGIS window, the
    Information Bar displays details about our current map view,
    including coordinates, scale, magnification level, and active CRS
    (Coordinate Reference System). It’s helpful for ensuring accurate
    spatial alignment and for referencing the precise location of our
    map elements.

7.  **Search Bar:** The Search Bar (or Locator Bar) allows us to quickly
    find tools, layers, and functions within QGIS. We can type in
    keywords like "Buffer" or "Raster Calculator" to access specific
    tools or commands without having to navigate through multiple menus.
    This feature speeds up our workflow and is especially useful for
    beginners still familiarizing themselves with the software.

## Spatial data sources

For this analysis, we'll need three spatial datasets. We've created a
project folder called `Kenya_Temperature_Analysis` to store these files.
To follow along, we suggest you create a similar directory to store all
the spatial data files used in this demo.

### Kenya boundary data

This vector shapefile contains the administrative boundaries of Kenya.
This will be useful as a reference layer for clipping and other spatial
operations. We'll need boundaries for the **level-0** administrative
boundary—that is, the country's border.

There are a variety of resources available to obtain administrative
boundary data. In the past, we've download data from the DHS [Spatial
Data
Repository](https://spatialdata.dhsprogram.com/boundaries/#countryId=KE&view=table).
For this post, we've decided to download our data from the Database of
Global Administrative Areas (GADM)
[website](https://gadm.org/download_country.html) because it provides
level-0 data directly.

From the GADM website, select "Kenya" in the country drop-down and
download the border data in **shapefile** format. This will provide a
compressed folder containing multiple files (e.g., `.shp`, `.dbf`,
`.shx`, `.prj`) that are essential for the shapefile to function
correctly in GIS software. The file may be compressed, so be sure to
**extract all files into the same directory**, as QGIS requires them to
be together for proper rendering. Save this extracted folder under your
overall project folder.

### Temperature raster data

We've introduced CHIRTS in [previous
posts](../2024-04-15-chirts-metrics/), but so far we've always used
daily data. To simplify things for this post, we'll use the CHIRTS
monthly data product instead.

We'll use monthly maximum temperature (Tmax) data for 2016, which you
can download from the [CHIRTS
website](https://data.chc.ucsb.edu/products/CHIRTSmonthly/CHIRTSmax.CDR/).
Each file represents the maximum temperature for a specific month from
January 2016 (`CHIRTSmax.2016.01.tif`) to December 2016
(`CHIRTSmax.2016.12.tif`) These files will allow us to calculate the
2016 annual average maximum temperature.

Once you've downloaded these files, you'll want to put them in their own
sub-directory within your project. In our case, we've called this
directory `CHIRTS`.

### DHS cluster data

As we've done in many posts, we'll use geolocated DHS cluster
coordinates to identify the
[displaced](https://www.dhsprogram.com/Methodology/GPS-Data.cfm)
locations of DHS sample clusters for Kenya.

As we've described before, to obtain the GPS coordinates for a specific
sample, you’ll have to [log
into](https://dhsprogram.com/data/dataset_admin/login_main.cfm?CFID=383700816&CFTOKEN=16c528fbeaf1728c-A7BFFD55-B0EE-D4A3-72A7D8F12D8ACE66)
your DHS Program account. Specify the country of interest (Kenya, in
this case), and, on the line for the appropriate sample year (we're
using the 2022 sample for this demo), click the link to download the GPS
coordinate data under the **GPS Datasets** heading.

::: column-margin
As always, you'll need to have a registered DHS project to download data
for these cluster coordinates. If needed, you can always use the
workflow from this demonstration with data from another DHS sample and
area if you haven't requested permission for Kenya samples specifically.
:::

You’ll be presented with a new page containing a list of download links.
Scroll down to the **Geographic Datasets** section. Download the file
listed as a shapefile (.shp).

Once downloaded, save the shapefile into a sub-folder under your project
folder to keep everything organized. For the 2022 sample, the downloaded
file name should be `KEGE8AFL.shp`.

# Importing and organizing spatial data in QGIS

## Preparing our project

Before we can begin, we need to initiate a QGIS project to store our
work and add the data sources identified above to our project.

#### 1. Create a new QGIS project

Open QGIS and create a new project by navigating to [Project ‣
New]{.menu-instr}.

Save the project by navigating to [Project ‣ Save]{.menu-instr}. Provide
a project name (in our case, we've used `Spatial_Analysis_Kenya.qgz`)
and select the designated project folder we created previously
(`Kenya_Temperature_Analysis`). Saving the project file ensures we can
pause and resume our work without losing progress.

#### 2. Add the temperature raster data

Select [Layer ‣ Add Raster Layer]{.menu-instr}. Navigate to the `CHIRTS`
sub-folder within our project folder and select all the monthly raster
files (`CHIRTSmax.2016.01.tif` to `CHIRTSmax.2016.12.tif`). Click
[Add]{.menu-instr} to load the rasters into QGIS.

#### 3. Add the Kenya shapefile

Go to [Layer ‣ Add Layer ‣ Add Vector Layer]{.menu-instr}. Browse to the
Shapefiles sub-folder and select the Kenya boundary shapefile (If you
downloaded from GADM, the file should be named `gadm41_KEN_0.shp`).
Again, click [Add]{.menu-instr} to add the shapefile to our QGIS
project.

#### 4. Load the DHS cluster data

Go to [Layer ‣ Add Layer ‣ Add Vector Layer]{.menu-instr} to import the
DHS cluster shapefile ('KEGE8AFL.shp'). Click [Add]{.menu-instr}.

At this point, your interface should look something like @fig-3:

::: column-page
![QGIS interface with initial data layers
loaded](images/Fig3.png){#fig-3}
:::

## Organizing and visualizing layers in QGIS

When we import data into QGIS, it is represented in its raw form and at
its full spatial extent (as in @fig-3). To make sense of this data and
facilitate analysis, it's crucial to understand some basic organizing
and visualizing tools within QGIS. These tools help us manage the
appearance and arrangement of layers, ensuring that the data is clear
and easy to interpret.

#### Layer visibility and order

Layers in QGIS are displayed based on their order in the Layers Panel.
Make sure that the DHS cluster shapefile is on top, followed by the
Kenya boundary shapefile, and then the raster layers. This will help
maintain a clean and visible map. You can reorder layers by dragging
them up or down within the Layers Panel.

#### Zoom to layer

After adding layers, it's useful to zoom in on specific layers for
better visualization:

-   Right-click on a layer in the Layers Panel and select [Zoom to
    Layer(s)]{.menu-instr}.
-   This adjusts the map view to focus on the full extent of the
    selected layer, making it easier to work with your data.

If you lose track of your map (which happens often in QGIS!), using
[Zoom to Layer(s)]{.menu-instr} can quickly help re-center the view on
any specific dataset.

#### Working with coordinate reference systems {#project-crs}

We've mentioned coordinate reference systems in [previous
posts](../2024-09-13-leaflet-pt1/#coordinate-reference-systems). As was
the case there, it's worth confirming the CRS of the layers in QGIS to
ensure that we're conducting the expected spatial operations. To check the
CRS of a layer:

-   Right-click on any layer (e.g., the Kenya shapefile or DHS
    clusters) and select [Properties]{.menu-instr}.
-   In the [Information]{.menu-instr} tab, check the CRS of the
    layer, shown as an EPSG code (e.g., EPSG:4326 for WGS 84).

QGIS also sets a project-wide CRS, which is used for on the fly projection.
To check or change the CRS of the project, click on the
CRS displayed in the bottom-right corner of the QGIS window.
Make sure that the project CRS matches the CRS of your layers
for consistent spatial alignment.

::: callout-note
While you're working, QGIS projects layers "on the fly". That is, if you
have layers in different reference systems, QGIS will visualize them in
the single project CRS so that the layers align visually. However, this
doesn't actually project any layer's *data* to a new CRS. Thus, for
spatial analysis, you'll want to double check to ensure each layer is in
an appropriate CRS for the operations you're conducting.
:::

##### Change the CRS of the DHS cluster point shapefile

As we've discussed [before](../2024-02-04-dhs-chirps/#cluster-buffers),
we need to project our cluster points before we can buffer them, as we
want to buffer in units of meters, not degrees. For Kenya, an
appropriate projection is UTM zone 37S (EPSG:32737).

::: column-margin
Refer to [EPSG.io](https://epsg.io/) to identify the EPSG code for a
given projection and for help identifying projection properties.
:::

There are two ways to reproject the vector layer in QGIS:

-   Method 1: Export the layer

    -   Right-click the DHS cluster layer (`KEGE8AFL`)
    -   Select [Export ‣ Save Features As]{.menu-instr}
    -   In the [CRS]{.menu-instr} section, choose the appropriate UTM
        projection. In our case, we will use zone 37S. Provide a
        simple name to the reprojected shapefile (e.g., `Clusters.shp`) and
        save.

-   Method 2: Reproject via Data Management

    -   Navigate to [Vector ‣ Data Management Tools ‣ Reproject
        Layer]{.menu-instr}
    -   In the window that opens, select the DHS cluster layer as the
        [Input Layer]{.menu-instr}
    -   Choose the appropriate UTM projection (again, UTM 37S in our
        case) in the [Target CRS]{.menu-instr} section.
    -   Click [Run]{.menu-instr} to complete the reprojection. By
        default this creates a temporary layer, but you also have the
        option to specify an output file.
        
#### Symbology and visualization

Symbology refers to the visual representation of our data on the map. We
can adjust symbology to make for a more interpretable and visually
appealing map.

1.  Right-click on the Kenya shapefile and select [Properties ‣
    Symbology]{.menu-instr}.

2.  Choose *Outline: Simple Line* in the [Symbol layer
    type]{.menu-instr} field to help distinguish the boundary from the
    background raster layers. Feel free to explore other symbology
    options to familiarize yourself with the interface. Click
    [Apply]{.menu-instr} to periodically apply changes to the map, and
    [OK]{.menu-instr} when you're satisfied.

3.  For the DHS clusters, use a *Simple Marker* layer type to mark each
    point clearly on the map. Play around with colors, strokes, and line
    weights until you're satisfied and click [OK]{.menu-instr}.

4.  For our CHIRTS data, change the [Render Type]{.menu-instr} to
    *singleband pseudocolor*. You can select from several pre-made color
    ramps or design your own by clicking the [Color Ramp]{.menu-instr}
    drop-down arrow. In our case, we're using the Spectral color ramp.

    You'll also want to change the [Min]{.menu-instr} option to
    something much greater than -9999 (we're using -10 for now). By
    default, the raster color scheme will use the full range of the data
    and expand to accommodate extreme values like -9999, which represent
    "no data" areas. This distorts the color scale. Adjusting the
    minimum and maximum values allows for better visual representation
    and more accurate analysis of the data.

@fig-4 presents an example QGIS interface after applying the
organization and visualization techniques discussed. It's okay if your
symbology looks a little different from ours. We recommend that you take
the time to explore the available [symbology
options](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/training_manual/basic_map/symbology.html),
as they offer interesting ways to enhance your data presentation and
analysis.

# Geoprocessing in QGIS

## Temporal aggregation using raster calculator

Since we have 12 raster layers representing monthly maximum temperatures
(Tmax) for the year 2016, we can perform temporal aggregation by
averaging these layers.

In this example, we will calculate the annual average Tmax for 2016.
Navigate to [Raster ‣ Raster Calculator]{.menu-instr}. In the calculator
window, we need to enter the formula to calculate the average from each
of the 12 raster bands. To do so, you can double click on each raster
band in the [Raster Bands]{.menu-instr} selection pane to bring it in
the expression bar. To add addition and division operators, you can type
them directly into the expression bar or add them from the drop-down
[Operators]{.menu-instr} panel.

You should end up with an expression in the expression bar that looks
like the one shown in the [Raster Calculator Expression]{.menu-instr}
box shown in @fig-5. This formula sums the values from all 12 months and
divides by 12 to obtain the average temperature for the year. Name the
output file as `Annual_Average_Tmax_2016.tif` and save it in an
appropriate folder within your project directory (@fig-5). We can keep
the defaults for the other options.

::: callout-tip
After selecting a file location, the raster calculator window may
disappear behind the main QGIS window. Be sure to find this window and
officially run the process, or it will appear as if nothing has
happened!

This may occur with other geoprocessing tools as well.
:::

The new raster will appear as a new layer in our Layers Panel, and you
can apply the same singleband pseudocolor scheme for visualization to
better interpret the temperature data. We can remove the single-month
files from QGIS to keep things tidy (right click on the single-year
layers and select [Remove layer]{.menu-instr}).

::: column-page-inset
![Raster Calculator window](images/Fig5.png){#fig-5}
:::

## Clipping raster to the area of interest

Clipping the raster to the Kenya boundary is important because it
ensures that our analysis is focused only on the area of interest,
eliminating unnecessary data from outside the country’s borders and
reducing file size for better processing.

To perform this task, we will follow a simple process in QGIS. First, we
will navigate to [Raster ‣ Extraction ‣ Clip Raster by Mask
Layer]{.menu-instr}.

In the window that appears, we will set the [Input Layer]{.menu-instr}
to the newly generated annual average raster
(`Annual_Average_Tmax_2016.tif`). Then, for the [Mask
Layer]{.menu-instr}, we will select the Kenya boundary shapefile
(`gadm41_KEN_0.shp`). This ensures that the raster is clipped to the
boundaries of Kenya. Finally, we will name the output file as
`Kenya_Clipped_Tmax_2016.tif` and save it in the `CHIRTS` folder
(@fig-7).

::: column-page-inset
![Clip Raster window](images/Fig7.png){#fig-7}
:::

After the process is complete, we will have a new raster that only
covers the extent of Kenya, ready for further analysis. We can remove
the full extent raster file from the layer panel and use the singleband
pseudocolor scheme for better visualization. Notice that the minimum
value in this case is already accurate as we do not have missing data
within this clipped raster (@fig-8).

::: column-page-inset
![Results of raster clip, with updated
symbology](images/Fig8.png){#fig-8}
:::

## Buffering DHS cluster points

Creating buffers around point locations is crucial for spatial analysis
because it allows us to define areas of influence or impact around each
point, enabling more focused environmental or demographic analysis. In
this post as in [previous
ones](../2024-02-04-dhs-chirps/#cluster-buffers), we are interested in
creating buffers around the point locations of the geolocated DHS
clusters.

To create buffers, we will go to [Vector ‣ Geoprocessing Tools ‣
Buffer]{.menu-instr}. In the window that opens, we will set the [Input
Layer]{.menu-instr} to be the *reprojected* DHS cluster file. Next, we
will specify a buffer distance of 10,000 meters, which creates a 10 km
zone around each cluster point. Finally, we will save the output as
`DHS_10km_Buffers.shp` in the `Shapefiles` folder (@fig-9). Once this
process is complete, we will have buffer zones around the DHS clusters,
ready for further spatial analysis and extraction of environmental data.

::: column-page-inset
![Spatial buffer window](images/Fig9.png){#fig-9}
:::

::: callout-warning
If you haven't successfully [reprojected](#project-crs) the cluster
location shapefile, you won't be able to buffer in meters. Double check
the CRS of the layer as described previously and ensure that the layer
has been projected to UTM coordinates.
:::

As with other layers, we can adjust the symbology of the buffer regions
(e.g., to decrease opacity) by right clicking the layer in the
[Layers]{.menu-instr} pane and selecting [Properties ‣
Symbology]{.menu-instr}.

Using the [Magnifier]{.menu-instr} tool in the bottom right, we can zoom
into specific areas to inspect parts of the map without changing the
overall map scale, which helps in closely examining details (@fig-10).

![Use the Magnifier tool to inspect geoprocessing
output](images/Fig10.png){#fig-10 fig-align="center"}

## Aggregating raster values

Extracting environmental data at aggregated levels, such as within
buffer zones, allows us to quantify environmental conditions (in this
case, temperature) in specific areas. This process helps in identifying
patterns and relationships between environmental factors and outcomes in
defined regions and their populations.

We are interested in aggregating buffer-level Tmax statistics. To
aggregate the data, go to [Processing ‣ Toolbox ‣ Raster analysis ‣
Zonal Statistics]{.menu-instr}.

::: column-margin
If you can't find a tool, you can always search for it in the search
bar. For instance, a search for "Zonal statistics" would reveal where
the tool is located.
:::

In the window that opens, set the [Input Layer]{.menu-instr} to
`DHS_10km_Buffers.shp` and the [Raster Layer]{.menu-instr} to
`Kenya_Clipped_Tmax_2016.tif`. Set the [output column
prefix]{.menu-instr} to `"Tmax_"`. Under [Statistics to
calculate]{.menu-instr}, choose *Mean* to compute the average
temperature for each buffer based on the raster pixels within that
buffer. Save the file in the Shapefile sub-folder with the name
`Mean_Tmax_buffer.shp` (@fig-11).

![Zonal Statistics window](images/Fig11.png){#fig-11 fig-align="center"}

With this, we now have a new shapefile that includes a new column
(`Tmax_mean`) in the buffer layer’s attribute table, representing the
mean temperature for each buffer zone (@fig-12). You can verify this by
opening the attribute table (right-click on the new layer and select
[Open Attribute Table]{.menu-instr}). To export the attribute table as a
CSV file, right-click on the layer, go to [Export ‣ Save Feature
As]{.menu-instr}, or save it in another tabular format. It is crucial to
keep the unique cluster ID (`DHSID`) linked to the extracted data for
easy reference and further analysis.

::: column-page-inset
![](images/Fig12.png){#fig-12}

# Conclusion and next steps

With the extracted environmental data for each DHS cluster, you now have
a powerful dataset that can be linked to a wide range of health and
demographic variables available in DHS surveys. This integration can
reveal patterns that might not be visible through traditional analysis,
providing a more nuanced understanding of how environmental factors
interact with population health and social variables.

By incorporating other spatial data sources—such as additional
environmental variables or socioeconomic indicators—you can build a more
comprehensive picture of the contextual factors influencing health
outcomes. This type of spatial analysis opens up opportunities for
advanced research, allowing you to explore environmental determinants
and inform targeted strategies for improving population health and
well-being.

While this post just barely scratches the surface of the functionality
available with QGIS, it can serve as a starting point for you to keep
exploring and learning about the other features the software has to
offer.
