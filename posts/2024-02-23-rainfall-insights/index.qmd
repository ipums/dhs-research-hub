One barrier to climate change and health research is that many
surveys—including the [The Demographic and Health Surveys Program
(DHS)](https://dhsprogram.com/)—do not collect detailed information on
local environmental conditions in survey areas. Fortunately,
organizations like [IPUMS DHS](https://www.idhsdata.org/idhs/) are now
taking steps to use DHS enumeration cluster coordinates to link a
limited set of climate variables—including monthly and long-term average
precipitation—to individual and household records within the
DHS.[@boyle_contextual_2020]

However, in many cases, these pre-calculated time series may not meet
researchers' needs because they reflect only average conditions and not
the experience of the specific surveyed households. To obtain a more
nuanced understanding of a survey response's environmental context, some
researchers may choose to calculate and link climate variables
themselves. We introduced some methods for doing so in our [recent
post](../2024-02-04-dhs-chirps/index.html), where we demonstrated how to
integrate raw precipitation data from the [Climate Hazards Center
InfraRed Precipitation with Station
Dataset](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps) (CHIRPS) with survey data
from IPUMS DHS.

This post aims to serve as a guide for new researchers wading into
research on the health impacts of climate events. While we focus on
rainfall, it is important to note that there are significant
interactions between rainfall and other variables such as temperature
and vegetation. Furthermore, rainfall alone may be a crude measure; for
instance, Grace et al. (2021) highlight multiple and nuanced ways in
which precipitation can impact health.[@grace_exploring_2021]
Nevertheless, this blog post outlines key concepts to consider when
thinking through the health impacts of precipitation patterns, selecting
a data source, and operationalizing precipitation data. We draw examples
from recent publications that utilize DHS data; however, their inclusion
does not constitute an endorsement of the publications themselves.

## Impacts of rainfall on human health

Rainfall can impact human health in both direct and indirect ways, with
important consequences when linking precipitation data to survey
responses. For instance, researchers interested in indirect mechanisms
may need to incorporate a time lag between climate events and survey
response dates, since the impact of rainfall events in one period may
not appear until later.[@grace_building_2020]

Below, we outline several of the most common pathways through which
precipitation impacts health outcomes.

### Disasters and precipitation extremes

**Direct and immediate impacts on human health**

Extreme rainfall can result in flooding or landslides, which may lead to
death or injury. Furthermore, extreme events often contribute to
indirect health impacts through the other pathways described below.

### Agriculture and nutrition

**Indirect impacts on human health**

Rainfall directly impacts crop growth and agricultural productivity,
which then affects food security and nutrition. It takes time for plants
to grow, so the impacts on health and well-being may not be immediate.

Precipitation is not the only variable that can be used to explore these
pathways; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can also be used
as a proxy for food security.[@grace_exploring_2021]

### Infectious diseases

**Indirect impacts on human health**

Rainfall can impact the transmission of enteric disease like cholera
(through its effects on sanitation practices, water quality, and
hygiene) as well as vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue
(through its effects on water supply and vector habitats).

Ideally, researchers would be able to explore these pathways through
more proximate measures of transmission risks like disease incidence.
However, in resource-poor settings these data may not be available at
fine temporal and spatial resolutions.

### Crime and violence

**Indirect impacts on human health**

Rainfall shocks may be linked to crime and violence through their
impacts on economic activities, stress, and competition for limited
resources. For instance, rainfall impacts on economic security may lead
to herder and farmer conflicts.

## Choosing a rainfall data source

The specific research question and estimation strategy should play a
central role in determining the most suitable rainfall data source.
Researchers have various factors to consider when making this choice,
including the available time span[@abiona_adverse_2017;
@hyland_water_2019], the manner in which data were collected (for
instance, accurate ground-based station data versus satellite
data),[@le-utero_2021] and the extent of coverage for the geographic
location of interest.[@randell_climate_2019]

### Data accuracy

It’s important for researchers to recognize the trade-offs between data
accuracy and coverage. In many cases, more accurate products will have
more limited geographic coverage, so researchers with a small area of
interest may be able to use a more accurate data product.

### Temporal resolution

Researchers must also consider the temporal resolution of the data (e.g.
hourly, daily, monthly, etc.). An appropriate temporal resolution is
likely to depend on the characteristics of the survey data that will be
joined to the environmental data. For instance, it may not be necessary
to use hourly precipitation data when linking to the DHS, since survey
response dates are often provided only at the monthly level. However, it
is always possible to aggregate fine-grained data to a larger temporal
scale, and fine-grained data may provide more flexibility in the way
aggregation is carried out.

### Spatial resolution

The majority of rainfall data is available in [raster
format](../2024-02-04-dhs-chirps/#chirps-precipitation-data), wherein
precipitation data are stored in a grid of cells, each with a particular
precipitation value. If the grid cells are very large and encompass many
DHS clusters, there won’t be enough variation to exploit in an analysis.
On the other hand, if the grid cells are less than 10 kilometers across
(a plausible [buffer size](../2024-02-04-dhs-chirps/#cluster-buffers)
around DHS cluster coordinates), then their values will need to be
aggregated within each DHS cluster region.

### Data accessibility

Of course, data availability and accessibility often drive data source
decisions. Researchers may opt to use data that they or collaborators
have previously used or have easy access to in order to reduce the
difficulty of setting up an analysis with a new source.

## Measuring rainfall

Scholars frequently aggregate total rainfall over an interval (for
instance, to calculate annual, seasonal, or monthly precipitation
summaries). Additionally, researchers often generate long-term rainfall
averages for use in identifying anomalies and extreme rainfall
events.[@grace_building_2020] It is imperative that researchers justify
their choice of temporal aggregation.

In this section, we summarize several publications that highlight
different techniques for measuring rainfall.

### Total precipitation

Studies that simply use raw precipitation totals are able to test
whether additional rainfall has a negative or positive impact on the
outcome of interest.[@Mukabutera2016]

#### Total precipitation during the growing season

Some studies restrict their focus to a region's growing season to better
assess the impacts of climate conditions on agricultural production
and—indirectly—nutrition and food security.[@grace_linking_2015]

#### Total rainy season precipitation

Specific details of the geographical area of interest may inform the
manner in which data are aggregated. For instance, Randell, Gray, and
Shayo (2022) take region-specific rainfall patterns into account in
research on Tanzania, where depending on the region there might be one
(Msimu) or two rainy seasons (Masika and Vuli) during the
year.[@randell_climatic_2022]

### Rainfall variability and anomalies

Measures of rainfall *variability* consider how rainfall at a specific
time and location compares to the long-term average rainfall in that
same location. However, several measures of variability exist, and
information should be provided to explain how the reference period was
chosen and how results change if the reference period changes.

#### Annual variability

-   **Rainfall deviation percentile** can be used to quantify how a
    specific rainfall event compares to historical data for that same
    location. For instance, in Epstein et al. (2023), the 50th
    percentile represents a year with median rainfall levels compared to
    29 previous years; numbers closer to 0 represent drier than average
    years and closer to 1 represent wetter
    years.[@epstein_precipitation_2023]

-   **Rainfall Z-scores** quantify how many standard deviations a
    rainfall event differs from the mean. Negative Z-scores indicate
    below-average rainfall while positive Z-scores indicate
    above-average rainfall.[@thiede_climate_2020]

-   **Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)** is similar to the Z-score
    but first corrects for the skew found in rainfall distributions by
    transforming the data using a gamma
    distribution.[@hyland_water_2019]

#### Seasonal variability

Rainfall is often seasonal, and depending on the health pathway of
interest, researchers should think critically about how seasons may
impact their analyses. Rainfall during the dry season is likely to have
a different effect than rainfall in the wet season, for
instance.[@bandyopadhyay_impact_2012]

-   Randell et al. (2021) calculate Z-scores for 2015 monsoon rainfall
    based on monsoon rainfalls during 1980-2015 reference
    period.[@randell_food_2021]

-   Omiat and Shively (2020) calculate deviation during the main
    rainfall season of the survey year and of the previous
    year.[@omiat_rainfall_2020]

-   Abiona (2017) calculates the percentage deviation from the mean
    agricultural season average. Specifically, this was generated using
    the natural logarithm of the current agricultural season minus the
    30-year historical average for the same
    locality.[@abiona_adverse_2017]

#### Climate variability during specific windows in the respondent's life course

Environmental analyses should be tied to survey responses during
specific exposure windows to determine the impact of
extremes.[@grace_building_2020] For instance, research on the impact of
precipitation on weight at birth may want to focus on precipitation
anomalies during the months of gestation. Or, if gestational length is
unknown, researchers may choose to use anomalies during the 12 months
prior to birth. It is often necessary to make approximations like this
based on the available data.

-   In studying in-utero rainfall variability, Le and Nguyen (2021) use
    "the deviation of the nine-month in-utero rainfall from the long run
    average of total rainfall during those nine months".[@le-utero_2021]
    In this case, the long-run average was based on data from 1981-2018.
    The authors further dichotomized their results in order to more
    easily summarize the impact of wet versus dry shocks.

### Precipitation extremes: Floods and droughts

It is uncommon for researchers to use rainfall data alone to define a
flood event. Instead, an indicator for flood is generated based on
precipitation anomalies. Consequently, we recommend using the term
*extreme rainfall* rather than *flood event* when relying solely on
rainfall data.

Researchers often use rainfall data alone to identify droughts, though
in these instances they are really capturing **meteorological**
droughts.[@mishra_review_2010] Depending on the type of drought of
interest, researchers may want to use a combination of temperature,
rainfall, and other data sources to identify droughts associated with
low soil moisture (**agricultural** droughts), low ground water, or
surface runoff. As with all environmental metrics, researchers should
think critically about time scales when operationalizing drought; a
drought lasting 1 month is likely to have a very different effect than a
drought lasting 6 or 12 months.

Specific drought indices are also available to identify drought
conditions. The Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI)
takes into account rainfall as well as evaporation, and the Palmer
Drought Severity Index (PDSI) includes rainfall, evapotranspiration, and
runoff.

Below we highlight some ways researchers using DHS data have used
rainfall data to quantify the impacts of extreme precipitation. These
examples illustrate that there are a wide range of cutoffs used to
identify droughts. While this makes comparisons difficult, it's
appropriate that drought should be defined specific to the place, time,
and water use patterns of a given region.

-   **Extreme rainfall:** rainfall deviation ≥ 90th
    percentile[@uttajug_association_2023]

-   **Flood:** rainfall deviation \> 75th
    percentile[@abiona_adverse_2017]

-   **Drought:** rainfall deviation is \< 25th
    percentile[@abiona_adverse_2017]

-   **Drought:** binary variable for rainfall ≤ 15th
    percentile[@nagata_drought_2021]

-   **Drought:** SPI values \< -1.5[@hyland_water_2019]

-   **Drought:** classified as ordinal categorical
    variable:[@epstein_drought_2020]

    -   *Severe* (≤ 10 percentile)
    -   *Mild/moderate* (\> 10th percentile to ≤ 30th percentile)
    -   *None* (\> 30th percentile)

## Context matters

#### How might the same shock have different effects in different regions?

Studies that span geographic areas with heterogeneous climatic zones and
other characteristics often stratify or interact rainfall with regional
characteristics. This is because the same rainfall event most likely
does not have the same impact on outcomes in areas with different
geographic features (for instance, in arid versus non arid
areas,[@kudamatsu_weather_2012] rural versus urban
areas,[@marteleto_climate_2023] or on individuals with different
livelihoods[@davenport_investigating_2020]).

This highlights the most important point when working with climate data:
no one-size-fits-all approach exists. The manner in which data are
selected, operationalized, and analyzed must be consistently informed by
the physical and cultural specifics of the geographic region under
consideration.

We hope that these drops of wisdom are a good starting point for your
research.
