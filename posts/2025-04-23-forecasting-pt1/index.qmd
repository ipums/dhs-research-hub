Climate and social scientists study past conditions to establish links
between environmental conditions and human behavior and health. Once
these patterns are identified, the interest may shift toward
understanding what they imply about the **evolution** of our health
outcomes as conditions change in the future.

Of course, studying future outcomes is no easy task, as it's impossible
to make concrete observations of phenomena that haven't happened yet!
Still, we often have enough information to make informed judgments about
what is likely to happen in the future.

This is the first in a series of posts that will discuss some of the
complexities involved when attempting to anticipate future conditions.
In this post, we'll establish the foundational terminology that will be
critical to understanding the concepts we introduce going forward.

# Scenarios, predictions, forecasts: What's the difference?

Climate and social scientists use several different terms when
discussing possible future outcomes. Some of the most common are
***scenarios***, ***forecasts***, and ***predictions***.

-   **Scenarios** attempt to describe the possible ways a system could
    evolve over time. These often include expert opinion on what time
    steps, thresholds, or drivers of different model output should be
    presented, but are still based on quantitative or numeric models.

-   **Forecasts** are usually short-term, numeric model estimates of
    physical phenomena which can have accuracy assessments embedded in
    them.

-   **Predictions** are used to describe estimates of future changes in
    the context of more complicated political, social, or biophysical
    changes. The term is often used as if it were synonymous with both
    scenarios and forecasts, but it typically emphasizes expert opinion.

While these terms refer to related or shared ideas, they have distinct
meanings and will be used in different ways in the upcoming posts in
this series. In the rest of this post, we'll elaborate on these
definitions and and tie these terms to real world examples.

| **Term** | **Dictionary Definition** | **Scientific Use** | **Example** |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Scenario | An imagined or projected sequence of events, especially any of several detailed plans or possibilities | Used to challenge assumptions, explore potential futures, and for strategic planning and risk management | Scenarios of different potential outcomes from the results of an election or policy change |
| Forecast | To estimate or conjecture the course of events or future condition of things based on present indications | A quantitative estimate of a future event or condition based on past and current data, using statistical models and trends | The weather forecast is for warm and dry conditions for the next week. |
| Prediction | The action of foretelling future events, a prophecy | Prediction often includes expert judgement and estimation of a future event or outcome. Can be based on information and expertise but does not necessarily include models or data. | Economists are predicting higher inflation due to unprecedented changes in trade policy. |

## Scenarios

**Scenarios** are the result of thought experiments or models that
incorporate information from a small subset of a multitude of events
that could occur. A scenario is a postulated sequence of events, which
considers the *possible* evolution of the events under consideration.
For instance, a scenario may consider the likely actions or decisions
made by governments or individuals within specific countries or
organizations.

Notably, scenarios do not affirm that these actions or decisions *will
actually* happen. Rather, they intend to illustrate the potential
ramifications of risks and uncertainties and highlight the possible
effects of government decisions and policy. Thus, scenarios can help
decision makers think through the potential consequences of their
decisions and consider alternatives that may improve outcomes.

For example, Lloyd's of London is a market regulator for insurance
providers and those that buy and sell insured risk in a global
marketplace. Lloyd’s maintains a set of [Realistic Disaster Scenarios
(RDS)](https://www.lloyds.com/conducting-business/underwriting/realistic-disaster-scenarios)
to stress test both individual syndicates and the market as a whole. The
disasters within these scenarios include climate events (e.g.,
[earthquakes](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/climate-change/can-climate-affect-earthquakes-or-are-the-connections-shaky/#:~:text=Scientists%20know%20earthquakes%20can%20be,studies%20have%20supported%20such%20correlations), floods, and windstorms in very high value markets in the
US, Japan, UK, and Europe) as well as terrorism and cyber attack events.
If an earthquake occurs in the San Francisco area, for instance, Lloyd’s
has estimated the losses for residential and commercial property
insurance to be around \$80 billion. The scenarios provide ways to
ensure the stability of the reinsurance market and to reduce exposure by
any one risk holder.

The United States government has a [sea level rise
tool](https://sealevel.globalchange.gov/national-sea-level-explorer/?view=map),
which provides a set of scenarios for the likely amount of sea level
rise that will be experienced in different coastal areas. The five
scenarios consider a variety of processes that could influence sea level
across a wide range of future warming conditions—specifically, the
amount of greenhouse gases emitted due to economic activity. They are
defined by target values of Global Mean Sea Level Rise in 2100. These
scenarios draw a direct connection between policy and action on climate
mitigation and the amount of area along the US coastline which will
likely be inundated by 2100.

The [Famine Early Warning System
Network](https://www.usgs.gov/international-programs/fews-net) (FEWS
NET) used scenarios to estimate future food insecurity four months into
the future through analysis of rainfall, harvests, commodity prices,
seasonal labor demand, government policy, international aid, and other
factors (see @fig-fews). The scenarios relied on analysis of the current
situation, assumptions about future changes, and the likely response to
events by various actors. Updated every month, the scenarios provided
members in the network guidance on appropriate responses to local
shocks, like drought or conflict.

Population scientists can employ scenarios when estimating future
population counts as well. Typically, population scenarios are
constructed by assuming constant, higher, or lower rates of core
population processes, like fertility, migration, and mortality. [Our
World in
Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-long-run-with-projections)
has a tool for users to create population projections based on
[fertility
scenarios](https://population.un.org/wpp/definition-of-projection-scenarios)
drafted by the United Nations.

## Forecasts

Unlike scenarios, which are estimates based on assumptions about context and 
response to events in the future, **forecasts** are model predictions based on 
current and historical data. Forecasts are always evaluated for their accuracy
and predictive ability using quantitative metrics. For example, the accuracy
of a weather forecast can be evaluated by comparing the prediction to
the observation dataset, allowing the forecast users to know whether the
forecast was able to predict events that occurred.


[Subseasonal to seasonal (S2S)
forecasts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169421011082)
extend short-term weather forecasts from two weeks to two years into the
future. While raw forecasts from S2S models are informative, calibration
is necessary to correct systematic biases and quantify forecast
uncertainty to facilitate applications such as scheduling agricultural
activities or planning outdoor events. Most S2S forecasts can predict
that it will be warm in summer and cool in winter, but being able to
forecast significantly above or below average temperatures in a
particular month is far more challenging.

Population scientists create population forecasts—predicted population
counts—using various methods depending on the amount of input
information available. The process of creating a population forecast is
called **population projection**. There is some debate on whether
population projections should be considered true forecasts, however, and
most population scientists refer to their projections as "estimates" to
showcase their professional caution.[@CarmichaelGordonA2016;
@HindeAndrew2014]

## Predictions

**Predictions** result from the expert analysis of information
that integrates knowledge from multiple disciplines. The term "prediction"
has the connotation of being less rigorous as it focuses on expert
knowledge and is based on flexible assumptions. Predictions may also
consider hypothetical conditions such as policy, politics or economic
changes.

Forecasts, in contrast, often represent events that are likely to occur
regardless of near-term government or individual actions, and are checked
for accuracy once future conditions have been observed. However, there
often is no direct way to determine the accuracy of a *prediction*
due to incomplete information on the system and the lack of a
specific model used in its creation.

For example, a government may decide to invest in subsidized fertilizer
for smallholders, but this may not affect the price of commodities in
the market in the current year given the impacts of broader
macroeconomic forces and immediate supply and demand. Forecasts of
drought impacts on crop production in the current year can’t be
influenced by agricultural policies made by governments, since those
investments take time to affect productivity. However, experts could
still make predictions about the likely long-term impact of the
investments.

# Looking ahead

This blog post is the start to a series covering scenarios,
forecasting, and population projections and how these concepts can be
applied to climate and child health research. The next post will explain
population projections in more detail and later posts will provide
technical examples of these methodologies and how they can be used
together.
