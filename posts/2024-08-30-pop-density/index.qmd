Researchers interested in understanding population distribution in the
Global South are faced with a dilemma: data identifying where
communities are and how many people live in them often does not exist.
National censuses commonly report populations in aggregates, at
province, district, or county levels—spatial resolutions much too coarse
for studies of climate change or health.

Datasets that *estimate* how and where many people live (**population
density layers**) do exist, but differ in fundamental ways, and the
choice of which dataset to use depends on the scale and scope of the
research question. For instance, some datasets are better at identifying
built-up areas, while others excel at measuring rural populations.
Similarly, researchers who need to understand how many people live in
peri-urban areas would not benefit from a dataset that uses a
dichotomous urban/rural variable to define built-up areas.

Furthermore, researchers studying change in population over time should
be aware of comparability issues since some data providers update their
methods regularly, making their datasets less comparable from year to
year. Still, gridded population data are often the most effective tool
for researchers to understand large-scale population distribution and
explore human-environment relationships. Given the nuance of these
datasets, how can we effectively include population density in our
analyses?

As a start, this post will introduce several of the most widely-used
population datasets:

-   Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP)
-   Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL)
-   LandScan
-   WorldPop

Below, discuss each source's history, input data layers, and methods
used in its development. This can serve as a starting point for
researchers to explore each dataset in more depth to determine which may
be most appropriate for their specific research area.

# Background

As fields of study related to climate, health, and population grew in
the 1970s and 80s, researchers began to recognize that a deeper
understanding of population distribution was needed. Censuses are costly
and populations are dynamic; it became apparent that datasets estimating
where people live needed to be combined with census data.

The need to fill the gap in population data availability led to the
development of the first global gridded population dataset in the 1990s
(see @fig-1): the Gridded Population of the World (GPW).[@Tobler1995;
@Deichmann1996; @CIESIN] By combining population counts from censuses at
second-administrative levels (i.e. counties and districts) with
spatially-explicit administrative boundary data, researchers created a
raster dataset that depicts population counts at 5-minute grid
resolution (roughly 10km at the equator) on a continuous surface of the
earth.[@Balk2006] This data enabled researchers studying climate (data
that are commonly reported as a gridded surface) to incorporate
population into their analyses without aggregating climate data to
subnational administrative units.

Since then, advancements in the technology used to collect remote
sensing data, such as topography and land cover, have improved
identification of urban areas.[@Pesaresi2013] Increased computing power,
improved spatial accuracy, and use of additional datasets such as
night-time light satellite imagery, land cover, and digital elevation
models (called **ancillary data**) have enabled researchers to advance
the methods used to redistribute census population counts to grid cells
at high resolution and accuracy.[@Leyk2019] As a result, several gridded
population datasets have been developed using different methods and
input data, leading to datasets with varying spatial and population
accuracy depending on the context. Below, we'll highlight some of the
similarities and differences between the prominent gridded population
datasets that have been developed and identify appropriate use-case
scenarios.

# Common population density data sources

A comparison of the spatial resolution, temporal availability,
data/methods used, and best use cases for each of the four datasets
we're highlighting in this post are summarized in @tbl-1 below, while
@fig-1 (above) outlines the dates of first publication for each dataset.
Without a proper understanding of how these data products are developed
and their ideal use-cases, the research community is more likely to
choose the wrong dataset for their project.[@Leyk2018] In the subsequent
sections, we introduce each dataset in additional detail.

## Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP)

GRUMP is a series of global gridded population counts and densities
created by Columbia University's Centre for International Earth Science
Information Network (CIESIN) in 2004, available for years 1990, 1995,
and 2000.[@GRUMP] Using lightly-modeled dasymetric methods based on GPW
population and NOAA night-time lights, it indicates the locations of
urban settlements and delineates the spatial extents of urban areas at
30 arc-second (roughly 1 kilometer at the equator)
resolution.[@Leyk2019] In fact, it was the first global gridded
population dataset to define urban areas and was widely used for two
reasons:

-   its urban footprint is based on stable-city lights which is an
    inclusive measure of urban areas
-   the dichotomous definition of the urban footprint (urban or rural)
    is simple for researchers to use[@Macmanus2021]

GRUMP's popularity waned upon the creation of higher-resolution datasets
that became available for more recent years, including the Global Human
Settlement Layer (GHSL) created by the European Commission Joint
Research Centre (JRC) in 2010.

## Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL)

Available in 5-year intervals from 1975 to 2020, GHSL data products are
provided at a spatial resolution of 3 arc-seconds (roughly 100 meters at
the equator). GHSL utilizes Landsat imagery (prior to 2014) and
Sentinel-2 composite imagery (2014-forward) in an image classification
method called Symbolic Machine Learning (SML) to map urban land cover
and classify population and land area into seven classes along an
urban-rural continuum.[@Pesaresi2016; @Macmanus2021]

The GHSL population data product is made up of three datasets: GHS-POP
(population size), GHS-BUILT (built-up areas), and GHS-SMOD (a Degree of
Urbanization model grid that delineates settlement types using GHS-POP
and GHS-BUILT).[@Florczyk2019]

GHSL has been widely used to study the interactions between climate,
health, and populations. For example, Pinchoff and
colleagues[@Pinchoff2020] used GHS-BUILT to examine the impact of
urbanicity on health in Tanzania. McGranahan and
colleagues[@McGranahan2023] used GHS-SMOD to calculate urbanization
rates in low-elevation coastal zones and estimate the effect of
urbanization on climate change in deltaic regions. In another study, the
authors examined spatial accessibility to healthcare in sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA) using GHS-SMOD.[@Florio2023]

## LandScan

While it is a lower resolution data product, LandScan is another
prominent global population distribution dataset that provides ambient
(24-hour average) population distribution at 30 arc-seconds (roughly 1
kilometer at the equator) resolution, developed in 1998 by the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory in Tennessee.[@Dobson2000; @Rose2014]

In contrast to GRUMP and GHSL—which provide data at 5-year
intervals—LandScan is available annually from 2000 through 2022.
LandScan utilizes night-time light satellite imagery along with spatial
information about elevation (Digital Elevation Models), slope (Digital
Terrain Models), land cover, and populated place vector data within a
multivariable dasymetric model that uses machine learning to assign the
likelihood of population occurrence to each cell.

LandScan differs from other datasets in that it provides *ambient*
population distribution, depicting not only where people sleep but where
they travel, work, and socialize over a 24-hour period. While this may
be an important distinction for some researchers, it sets the dataset
apart from others, making it less comparable. Researchers should also
take caution when comparing multiple versions of LandScan data—regular
updates to the input data and distribution algorithm can cause
comparability issues between versions.

## WorldPop

WorldPop is another global gridded population distribution dataset that
provides annual estimates from 2000 through 2020; however, WorldPop is
provided at a higher resolution of 3 arc-seconds (roughly 100 meters at
the equator). Developed by the University of Southampton in 2013,
WorldPop uses Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery in combination with
spatial information on impervious surfaces (SRTM) and slope (DEM) in a
dasymetric model with machine learning to estimate population
distribution.[@Thomson2022]

WorldPop was created by combining three continental-scale population
datasets:

-   AfriPop (developed in 2009)
-   AsiaPop (developed in 2012)
-   AmeriPop (developed in 2013)

WorldPop's population estimates are fractional (not integer), which can
produce difficulties in interpretation since individual persons
obviously cannot be divided up over an area. Its prediction model is
good at estimating activity space with the caveat that it can
overestimate population density in peri-urban areas while
under-estimating population densities in urban centers.

: Comparison of Gridded Population Datasets {#tbl-1 .hover .bordered .column-page}


# Comparing sources

Representation of global population distribution is an increasingly
important topic for researchers interested in human-environment
interactions. It is vital that studies consider the advantages and
limitations of the dataset they choose, as it has implications for
statistical model outputs which can influence the conclusions drawn from
their results. Researchers may benefit from downloading multiple
datasets and comparing population density estimates based on each
dataset for their study area. An example comparison is shown in @fig-2,
a population density map of Nairobi, Kenya, depicting the spatial extent
of the Nairobi urban center based on the GHS settlement model (GHS-SMOD)
in an overlay with WorldPop population density. As the map shows, the
spatial extent of the urban area is not in complete agreement between
the two datasets.

![Map comparing the delineation of urban population density in Nairobi,
Kenya using GHSL and WorldPop](images/image2.png){#fig-2}

In future posts, we'll demonstrate methods to work with some of these
datasets in R!
