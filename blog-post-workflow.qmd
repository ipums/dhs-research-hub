# All users: First time setup

To work on the blog, you'll need the following:

-   R
-   RStudio
-   Git
-   A few particular R packages

If you're working on your own machine, follow the instructions below to
get this software installed.

The MPC also hosts a [server instance](https://rstudio.pop.umn.edu/) of
R and RStudio, which you can access using your UMN login credentials. If
you prefer to work on the server, then R, RStudio, and Git will already
be installed. However, you will still need to install the indicated R
packages and configure your Git setup (if you haven't done so before),
so we still suggest reading through these instructions.

## Set up R and RStudio

### Install R

To install R, visit the [Comprehensive R Archive
Network](https://cloud.r-project.org/) (CRAN) and choose the appropriate
download link for your operating system.

### Install RStudio

RStudio is an interactive development environment (IDE) for R that
provides an interface and code editing tools that make it much, much
easier to write and edit R code.

The DHS Research Hub is organized as an [RStudio
Project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects),
which requires RStudio. You can download RStudio
[here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

### Install required R packages {#install-r-packages}

When you've got RStudio set up, install these R packages by running the
following in the RStudio console:

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# For writing blog posts
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("knitr")

# For help setting up Git
install.packages("usethis")
install.packages("gert")
install.packages("gitcreds")
```

::: callout-tip
If you have trouble installing any of these packages, try to install
them in a fresh RStudio session (in the RStudio toolbar, select *Session
\> Restart R*).
:::

## Configure Git and access blog materials

### Initialize your UMN GitHub account

The DHS Research Hub blog materials exist in both a **public** and
**private** format. When you're working on the blog, you'll be working
on the private site, which is hosted on the UMN Enterprise GitHub server
at <https://github.umn.edu/mpc/dhs-research-hub>.

The UMN GitHub server is accessible only to people affiliated with UMN.
By working in this environment, we can develop and edit new posts
without having to worry about them becoming visible on the public site
prematurely. Also, it allows us to store files necessary for certain
posts (e.g. IPUMS data files) without making those files publicly
visible. Members of the blog "admin" team will be responsible for
migrating completed posts to the public version of the site.

Since you're affiliated with UMN, you automatically have access to an
account on UMN GitHub. To initialize an account, visit
<https://github.umn.edu> and log in with your University Internet ID and
password.

### Install Git

To interact with GitHub, you'll need to install Git on your local
machine. Git is the version control software that allows us to track the
blog's history and manage line-by-line changes to files as we edit new
posts.

#### MacOS

MacOS comes with Git already installed. To confirm, you can check its
location by running `which git` in the Mac Terminal. You can also check
the version you have installed by running `git --version`.

If for some reason Git is not installed, use the [Install Git using
Homebrew](https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/ubc-r/session03_git.html#)
instructions to install it.

#### Other OS

Users of other operating systems should
[download](http://git-scm.com/downloads) the appropriate git for their
operating system.

### Link RStudio and Git

Next, we'll link RStudio and Git. This adds a new tab to your RStudio
interface where you can see your files being tracked by Git in a
convenient point-and-click format.

In the RStudio toolbar, select *Tools \> Global Options* and locate the
*Git/SVN* tab. Ensure that the box shown below is checked, and then
enter the location of the executable file. To find the git executable

-   **on MacOS**: run `which git` in Terminal
-   **on Windows**: look for `git.exe` in your file explorer (most
    likely in *Program Files*)

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/bpw/git-menu.png")
```

### Configure Git with your UMN GitHub credentials {#configure-git}

Finally, we'll provide Git with the username and email associated with
our UMN GitHub account. We'll also need to generate a Personal Access
Token (PAT) for our account. The PAT functions like a password that
allows you to interact with your UMN GitHub account from R and the
command line.

If you've installed the packages listed [above](#install-r-packages),
you can use R code (rather than the command line) to configure your
credentials. This is what we demonstrate below.

First, set the username and email address associated with your UMN
GitHub account. For example, I'd run:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
gert::git_config_global_set("user.name", "Finn Roberts")
gert::git_config_global_set("user.email", "robe2037@umn.edu")
```

::: callout-note
You don't necessarily need to store your credentials to use Git, but if
you don't, you'll have to enter them in a popup window each time you
interact with GitHub from R or the command line.
:::

Next, create a PAT for your account. Run the following in your RStudio
console to launch a webpage where you can configure a new PAT:

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
usethis::create_github_token(host = "https://github.umn.edu")
```

You can leave the default boxes checked and click the green *Generate
Token* button. This should display a long string of digitsâ€”this is your
new PAT. **Don't close this page yet!** Return to your RStudio console
and run:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
gitcreds::gitcreds_set("https://github.umn.edu")
```

This will prompt you to enter a new token. Follow the instructions to
copy and paste the PAT you just generated in your browser and press
*Enter*. From now on, RStudio and Git will be able to access your UMN
GitHub account automatically.

::: callout-note
If you have a personal GitHub account at
[https://github.com](https://www.github.com) you could repeat this
process substituting `"https://github.com"` for
`"https://github.umn.edu"`, and Git will automatically choose the right
credentials based on the repository associated with your project.
:::

### Clone the DHS Research Hub Repository

Now that we have Git configured, we can download (or *clone*) a copy of
the blog materials from UMN GitHub.

Open RStudio and navigate to *File \> New Project*, then select *Version
Control*:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bpw/version_control.png")
```

Choose *Git* to clone the project from a GitHub repository:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bpw/use_git.png")
```

On the next menu page, enter the address for the UMN GitHub repository:
`https://github.umn.edu/mpc/dhs-research-hub/`

Hit *Tab* and the project directory name should populate automatically.
If not, enter `dhs-research-hub` as the directory name:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bpw/clone_info.png")
```

::: callout-warning
Make sure to clone the **private** version of the repository (the one
located at github.umn.edu), not the **public** version (located at
github.com).
:::

In the third field, choose the location where you would like to store
the blog materials on your computer. This can be anywhere that makes
sense with your personal file organization approach.

::: column-margin
When choosing a place to save this project, *do not save to a network
drive*. This seems to cause RStudio to crash!
:::

Finally, click *Create Project*. After a short bit, RStudio will
relaunch and open the new project. If you adjust the windows to show the
**Files** (left) and **Git** (right) tabs, you should see something like
this:

::: column-page
![](images/bpw/clone_success.png)
:::

You have now downloaded a copy of the DHS Research Hub blog to your
computer!

Moreover, because you've connected these files to a GitHub repository,
the RStudio Project will now keep track of changes you make to the files
in this folder, and it will prompt you to upload your changes back to
GitHub: as you add, edit, or delete files, a list of changes will appear
in the Git tab.

::: callout-note
To ensure that RStudio recognizes the project is being used with Git,
make sure to open the `.Rproj` file before working on any of the blog
materials.

To open the project, simply click on the `dhs-research-hub.Rproj` file
or navigate to *File \> Open Project*. (You only need to do this once at
the start of your R session.)
:::

# Authors: Create a new post

### Working in Quarto {#working-in-quarto}

The DHS Research Hub is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
Quarto is an integrated system for generating technical documents,
presentations, and websites. Currently, Quarto supports several
programming languages, including R.

Quarto builds upon the popular RMarkdown framework for writing documents
with R. If you're already familiar with RMarkdown, most of what you've
already learned can be transferred to Quarto. For an overview of
Quarto's markdown syntax, check out this
[documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).

### Create a new branch

Git allows users to create what are called *branches* when working on a
project. A branch functions as an independent parallel version of all of
the blog materials. Any changes you make on a branch won't automatically
appear on the "main" branch of the repository. That means that you can
safely modify files in a separate environment without jeopardizing work
that has already been prepared for the blog.

To create a new branch, click on the purple icon in the Git tab of
RStudio (notice that it currently says "main", indicating we're
currently on the main branch of the repository):

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bpw/new_branch.png")
```

You can name the new branch anything you like, but we recommend using
your URL slug if possible (e.g. "blog-post-workflow" is the end of the
URL for this webpage). Leave the box next to *Sync branch with remote*
checked, as this will create your branch both locally and on our GitHub
page:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bpw/branch_name.png")
```

RStudio now displays the new branch name in place of "main" to show that
we're working on the new branch:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bpw/new_branch2.png")
```

Any changes you make here won't be reflected on the main branch, meaning
that the core content of the site is safe if you make a mistake on your
own branch.

### Create a new post directory

The `posts` directory contains the files for each of the blog's posts.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bpw/file_window1.png")
```

Each post has its own sub-directory inside the `posts` directory:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bpw/posts_list.png")
```

To create a new post, create a sub-directory inside `posts` with the
date and a shorthand name for the post. Within that directory, create a
new Quarto document (*File \> New File \> Quarto Document*) named
`index.qmd`. This should open up a blank file in your RStudio session as
shown below. Notice in the Git pane that Git has recognized that a new
directory has been added.

::: column-page
![](images/bpw/post_added.png)
:::

At this point, you can proceed to write your post in Quarto/RMarkdown
format, as mentioned [above](#working-in-quarto). As you're working on a
post, you can get a preview of what the post will look like on the site
by clicking the *Render* button in the toolbar above the .qmd document
you're editing.

::: column-margin
You can switch between previewing the page in the RStudio Viewer tab or
in your computer's default web browser. Click the settings icon next to
the *Render* button for preview options.
:::

### Post metadata

You'll notice that the .qmd file contains a **YAML header** with various
specifications about your post. The main options that you're likely to
use are:

-   `title`: the title of the post
-   `description`: brief subtitle of the post
-   `author`: the author(s) of the post (and their affiliations)
-   `date`: the publication date of the post (this will be modified by
    the site admin when publishing)
-   `categories`: tags that will be displayed and used to put posts into
    groups
-   `bibliography`: a .bib file that contains the citation information
    for any citations used in the post. This is used to automatically
    format the reference list that appears at the bottom of each post.
    Most citation managers have an option to export a .bib file.
-   `open-graph` and `twitter-card`: Specifications for the text and
    images to display when linking to this post (for instance, on
    Facebook, Twitter, etc.). In general, the title should be the same
    as the post title, with a `"IPUMS DHS Research Hub â€”"` prefix. The
    description can mirror the post description. The `image` field
    should be a file path (relative to the post location) to the image
    to use as a thumbnail that will accompany the link. Usually this
    will come from the body of the post.

As an example, here's the header for one of the posts on the blog:

``` {.yaml filename="posts/2024-02-04-dhs-chirps/index.qmd"}
---

If you're curious, you can check out the [Quarto
documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html) for
a comprehensive list of the available options.

### Put your data in `data`!

We have to be careful when working with IPUMS data for a post as we want
to avoid publishing any data to the public version of the site. However,
editors of your post will need to have access to your data when working
on the post.

To get around this, if you're working with IPUMS data in your post, put
it in a sub-directory called `data`. The admin team has set up a
workflow that will automatically remove contents of a post's `data`
directory when publishing to the public version of the site.

For example, we stored the DHS extract used in the `dhs-chirps` post
like so:

```         
./posts/2024-02-04-dhs-chirps/data/dhs/idhs_00018.dat.gz
./posts/2024-02-04-dhs-chirps/data/dhs/idhs_00018.xml
```

This structure will allow the data to be shared within the team in the
UMN GitHub repository, but will prevent those data from being published
publicly.

::: callout-tip
If you're working with any data that you don't even want to publish to
*UMN GitHub* (e.g. if the data files are too large), put those files in
a sub-directory called `data_local`. These files will automatically be
ignored by Git, but they will still be available on your local system.
:::

### Push your post to GitHub

When you're finished writing, you'll need to share (or *push*) your
changes to the UMN GitHub repository.

::: callout-note
Pushing to the UMN GitHub repository is not the same thing as publishing
your post to the live website. Your post won't go live until someone
from the admin team merges your post into the main branch and migrates
it to the public GitHub repository.
:::

Render your post one more time by clicking *Render*.

Now, enter the following commands into the RStudio console. This will
make a Git *commit*, which is simply a snapshot of the files in the
repository with an associated message describing the updates you're
making. Be sure to adjust brief commit message (in line 2) so it's
relevant to your new post:

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
gert::git_add(".")
gert::git_commit("New draft: blog-post-workflow") # Change this!
gert::git_push()
```

Now, if you visit the repository on UMN GitHub, your post will appear in
a new branch!

::: column-page
![](images/bpw/see_branches.png)
:::

# Editors: Review a new post

### Pull the author's branch to your computer

Any time that you want to review an author's post, you'll always need to
get the latest copy of their branch from the UMN GitHub repository. If
this is the first time you've read a draft for the post, the author's
branch won't yet be listed in RStudio.

The **Pull** button in RStudio's Git tab will gather information about
all of the new branches on GitHub, and it will download a copy of each
one onto your computer:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bpw/pull_button.png")
```

Returning to RStudio's main window, notice that you can now toggle
between the working on the remote `main` branch, or the new remote
branch (in this example, `blog-post-workflow`). When you're ready to
edit the author's post, use this menu to click their branch under *Local
Branches*.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bpw/toggle_branches.png")
```

RStudio will automatically create a local version of this branch on your
computer, and it should report that your changes will be tracked and
pushed to the remote branch of the same name.

### Locate and edit the new post

At this point, the Git tab should show that you're working on the
author's branch, and you'll see their post listed in the `posts` folder
in the Files tab. Navigate to the `index.qmd` file for their post and
open it to begin making edits.

You can edit using RMarkdown just as you would as an author. Remember
that you can preview the post by clicking the *Render* button at the top
of the file.

### Push the edited post back to GitHub

When you're finished editing, click the *Render* button one more time to
render a final HTML version of the page. (This may also generate other
ancillary files used on the site, which you'll see in the Git tab.)

Now, make a commit recording your edits (again, adjust the commit
message as appropriate).

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
gert::git_add(".")
gert::git_commit("Draft edited: blog-post-workflow") # Change this!
gert::git_push()
```

Now, if you visit our UMN GitHub repository, you'll see that your edited
files appear on the author's branch.

# Site Admin: Publish a new post

The following instructions demonstrate how to add an additional remote
to your local dhs-research-hub repository. **You only need to follow
these instructions if you are involved in managing updates to the live
blog.** All of these commands can be run in the RStudio Terminal.

### Rename UMN GitHub remote

Before adding a second remote, it's best to rename the UMN GitHub remote
to disambiguate it from the public repository remote that you will be
adding. You can check the current name with:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
git remote
```

By default, the remote will be called `origin`. We suggest renaming it
to `private`:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
git remote rename origin private
```

Similarly, you should also give the `private/main` branch a new name, as
the public repository will also contain a `main` branch.

To see all of the remote branches currently in use:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
git remote show private
```

Checkout `main` and change its name. We suggest `private-main`:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
git checkout main
git branch -m "private-main"
```

Now, add the **public remote** and fetch its branches (there should only
be one, called `main`):

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
git remote add public https://github.com/ipums/dhs-research-hub
git fetch public
```

Create a local branch called `public-main` set to track with `main` on
the `public` remote:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
git branch public-main public/main
```

At this point, you'll notice that RStudio shows two remotes (with the
branches you've fetched) and all of the local branches you've created so
far.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bpw/dual-remotes.png")
```

### Create a Git Hook to remove data from the public repo

**We should never push IPUMS data extracts to the public repository**,
but we need to have these data available on the private repository in
order to build each others' posts when we want to review or merge new
content.

Recall that all data used in a post should be stored in the `data`
directory. Fortunately, we don't have to manually delete every `data`
directory before merging to the public remote. Instead, we can use [git
hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) to automate the process of
deleting these files every time a post is merged to the public remote.

To do so, create a file called `post-merge` containing the following
code, and put it in the `.git/hooks/` directory:

``` {.bash filename=".git/hooks/post-merge"}
#! /bin/sh
green='\033[0;32m'
nc='\033[0m'

# Start from the repository root.
cd ./$(git rev-parse --show-cdup)

# Delete data files and empty directories.
if [ `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` == "public-main" ]; then
  echo "${green}Deleting data files...${nc}"
  find . -path '*/data/*' -delete
  find . -type d -empty -delete
fi
```

::: callout-note
This will only delete `data` folders if a branch called `public-main` is
currently checked out when we run `git merge` (see below). **If you gave
a different name to your local public branch, you'll have to edit this
code.**
:::

You also must make this file executable. For MacOS users, you can do
this by entering the following command into Terminal (assuming you're
already in the `dhs-research-hub` directory):

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-merge
```

Now, when you follow the merging steps below, any file saved in a
directory called `data` (including all sub-directories) will be deleted
automatically.

### Merge a new post

To merge a new post, we first need to merge the content from the
author's branch to the main branch of the private repository. Then, we
need to merge the main branch of the private repository to the main
branch of the public repository.

We follow a "squash and merge" workflow to help avoid creating divergent
commit histories between the private and public repositories:

1.  Squash and Merge the author's branch to `private/main`
2.  Build site, Commit, and Push to `private/main`
3.  Merge `private/main` to `public/main`
4.  Push to `public/main`

Our authoring/editing workflow generates a commit each time someone adds
a change to the branch for a new post. We will [squash and
merge](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/squash_and_merge.html)
this commit history into a single commit on `private/main`.

For example, with a new post on the branch `blog-post-workflow`:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
git checkout private-main
git merge --squash blog-post-workflow
```

Now that the post is merged, we can render the full site by running:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render
```

Look over the site to make sure everything looks good. It's also worth
double-checking the `git diff` to make sure that there aren't any
unexpected file changes that resulted from adding the new post. We won't
be making edits directly to the public repository, so this is the time
to make any final changes.

::: callout-tip
Reviewing Git changes is more easily done in a Git client interface.
Unfortunately, not all Git clients are freely available for GitHub
Enterprise repositories, but [GitHub
Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is one option that we find
helpful.
:::

When you're ready, add all files and commit your changes with a relevant
message:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
git add .
git commit -m "new post: blog-post-workflow"
```

Although your local branch has a different name than the branch on the
remote, you can still push your commit to the remote `main` with the
following command:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
git push private HEAD:main
```

<!-- You'll now see that the GitHub Pages site hosted at UMN GitHub should -->

<!-- update to reflect your changes. -->

To merge your `private-main` to `public-main`:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
git checkout public-main
git merge --squash --allow-unrelated-histories private-main -X theirs
```

::: callout-note
`--squash` once again squashes all changes in the private repository
into a single commit. This means that all changes since the last merge
to the public repository will be reflected in this commit. You may want
to update your commit message to reflect this fact (e.g. if you are
merging multiple posts at once).

`--allow-unrelated-histories` allows the merge even though the public
and private repositories do not share a baseline history. This isn't a
concern hereâ€”we don't want the public version of the site to reflect all
our small changes when working on posts.

`-X theirs` indicates that we want to defer to the changes on
`private-main` over those on `public-main` in the event that there are
any conflicts.
:::

At this point, review the files that will be included in the merge
commit. You should not see any `data` folders, as they should be deleted
automatically (if not, **delete them now**).

When you're ready to commit the merge, run the following (with a
relevant commit message):

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
git add .
git commit -m "new post: blog-post-workflow"
```

Finally, push the new post to the `main` branch of the public
repository:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
git push public HEAD:main
```

The new post has now gone live!
